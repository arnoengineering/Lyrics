Not Dead Yet,Not Dead Yet,LEDGER,"Called to the ring
Taking me round by round
It hurts and it stings
Taking me down, down, down
You think that you caught me
I can hear you taunt me
Fractured and I'm falling down
My enemy is watching me bleed

But I'm not dead yet
So watch me burn
Go on trying, lying, you're so sure
I may be broken
But I'm not done
I'll go on fighting, while there's breath in my lungs
'Cause I'm not dead yet
No, I'm not dead yet

You wait for the day
That I'll be counted out
You stand at my grave
Already breaking ground
But I don't think you know me
There's a side you don't see
Been to hell and made it out
My enemy, I'll watch you bleed

But I'm not dead yet
So watch me burn
Go on trying, lying, you're so sure
I may be broken
But I'm not done
I'll go on fighting, while there's breath in my lungs
'Cause I'm not dead yet
No, I'm not dead yet

I'm still awake
I won't go away
It's gonna take more than you can bring
Calling my name
Heaven is calling my name

But I'm not dead yet
So watch me burn
Go on trying, lying, you're so sure
I may be broken
But I'm not done
I'll go on fighting, while there's breath in my lungs
'Cause I'm not dead yet
No, I'm not dead yet

I'm still awake
I won't go away
It's gonna take more than you can bring"
Ruins,Ruins,LEDGER,"Just stay there for a minute
And just don't move any closer, move closer
I just don't know if I can take it
It feels like overexposure, move closer

Brick by brick and scar by scar
It's taken me years to put up these guards
I don't wanna get hurt again
Is it agony or ecstasy?
I feel safer now you're close to me
And fall apart

Once again I've broken, I've crumbled
I'm in pieces on the floor
Don't you know the damage you've done is
Just irreparable
You'll find me in the wreckage of a love so severe
And it's clear I just don't know what I'm doing
Your love left me in ruins
Won't you ruin me again?

You took my world as I know it
But I don't want any closure, move closer
Cause you've become that one thing
That I don't wanna get over, move closer

Is it disaster or destiny
That I feel so right with you next to me
And fall apart?

Once again I've broken, I've crumbled
I'm in pieces on the floor
Don't you know the damage you've done is
Just irreparable
You'll find me in the wreckage of a love so severe
And it's clear I just don't know what I'm doing
Your love left me in ruins
Won't you ruin me again?

Violent like a tidal wave
You hit me, blitzed me, shattered in a hurricane
Your love is the frame that holds me through it
I'm perfectly ruined

Once again I've broken, I've crumbled
I'm in pieces on the floor
Don't you know the damage you've done is
Just irreparable
You'll find me in the wreckage of a love so severe
And it's clear I just don't know what I'm doing
Your love left me in ruins
Won't you ruin me again?"
Warrior,Warrior,LEDGER,"Heart starts to pound
Shaking the ground
This is the sound
Heart starts to pound
Shaking the ground
This is the sound

This is the sound
It's the sound of the warrior
This is the sound
It's the sound of the warrior

The thief of hearts
You roam like a lion
Lie in the dark
To steal and kill a victim
This is the sound of the enemy's feet
This is the sound of me not retreating
I know what you are, and I won't let you fool me

Fade away
Like tears in rain
Nothing's forever, lets rise up together and say

This is the sound
It's the sound of the warrior (Woah)
This is the sound
It's the sound of the warrior (Woah)
Never give up
Never back down
I will die before I bow
This is the sound
It's the sound of the warrior (Woah)
[Verse 2: John Cooper, 
John Cooper & Jen Ledger
]
The words that fall from both sides of your lips
Like open jaws of shackles made for my wrist
This is the sound of the captives released
This is the sound of my enemies fleeing
The lights come on
The truth will be my victory
[Pre-Chorus: Jen Ledger & 
John Cooper
]
Fire away
Like tears in rain
Nothing's forever, lets rise up together and say
Rise up together and say

This is the sound
It's the sound of the warrior (Woah)
This is the sound
It's the sound of the warrior (Woah)
Never give up
Never back down
I will die before I bow
This is the sound
It's the sound of the warrior (Woah)

Heart starts to pound
Shaking the ground
This is the sound
Heart starts to pound
Shaking the ground
This is the sound

Can you hear the captives released?
Heart starts to pound, shaking the ground
Can you hear the enemies fleeing?
This is the sound, heart starts to pound
I can hear the captives released
Shaking the ground, this is the sound
My victory!

This is the sound
It's the sound of the warrior (Woah)
This is the sound
It's the sound of the warrior (Woah)
Never give up
Never back down
I will die before I bow
This is the sound
It's the sound of the warrior (Woah)"
My Arms,My Arms,LEDGER,"When did the scars over your heart
Become your hidin' place?
When did the stars become so dark
You couldn't find your way?

The light inside your eyes is fadin' out
But I'm not gonna give up on ya now

Don't be afraid
I know you think you're on your own
But you'll be okay
You don't have to go through it alone

Fall into My arms
Fall into My arms

So let me see the hurt underneath
I'm not a stranger to pain
'Cause I believe in what you can be
I'll never turn away (Away)

The light inside your eyes is fadin' out
But I'm not gonna give up on ya now

Don't be afraid
I know you think you're on your own
But you'll be okay
You don't have to go through it alone

Fall into My arms
Fall into My arms
You're not the one who needs to be strong
Fall into My arms

I see you right where you are
I hear the whisper of your heart
And it's okay to fall apart
I will carry you in My arms

Don't be afraid
I know you think you're on your own
But you'll be okay
You don't have to go through it alone

Fall into My arms (Into My arms)
Fall into My arms (Into My arms)
You're not the one who needs to be strong
Fall into My arms (Into My arms)

It's okay to fall apart
Just fall into My arms"
Foreigner,Foreigner,LEDGER,"The feast is set before me
It's on plates of platinum
But all I taste is ashes and my lips are turning numb
The smiles in the beauty and the promises I see
Glory, hallelujah never said it came for free
Ring around the roses
I see through your poses
Ashes to ashes
It all comes falling down

I thought I would belong right here
When I was younger
But there's something in the atmosphere
Whispers of wonder

I, I am a foreigner
Got a fire in my soul, never giving up
And I know I don't belong right here
I know I don't belong right here
Fight till I make it home
But keep my eyes to the skies even if I don't
And I know I don't belong right here
I know I don't belong right here

Hold out your hand of riches and display your royalty
I'm fine with my bloodline in a different dynasty
Worship at the altar of your vanity
I'll be in the Promised Land and let You be
London bridge is falling down
My fair lady holds her crown
Ashes to ashes
Where's your savior now?

I thought I would belong right here
When I was younger
But there's something in the atmosphere
Whispers of wonder

I, I am a foreigner
Got a fire in my soul, never giving up
And I know I don't belong right here
I know I don't belong right here
Fight till I make it home
But keep my eyes to the skies even if I don't
And I know I don't belong right here
I know I don't belong right here

I, I fix my eyes
On the island
Heavens
I, I fix my eyes
On the island
Heavens

I, I am a foreigner
Got a fire in my soul, never giving up
And I know I don't belong right here
I know I don't belong right here
Fight till I make it home
But keep my eyes to the skies even if I don't
And I know I don't belong right here
I know I don't belong right here"
Bold,Bold,LEDGER,"All this time
I have believed the lie
That I wasn't made to fly
My wings were bound, stuck to the ground

But I hear truth remind me
You are right behind me
Go ahead and break the mold

I'm gonna be bold
Gotta hold my head up
Cause I know when I get up
There's a victory I already hold
I'm gonna be strong
Gotta get my fight on
Cause I know whose side I'm on
Got a heart like steel, a faith like gold
I'm gonna be bold

Take a breath
Faith builds within my chest
Spirit in every step
I'm made for this and so I rest

Cause I hear truth remind me
You are right behind me
Go ahead and break the mold

I'm gonna be bold
Gotta hold my head up
Cause I know when I get up
There's a victory I already hold
I'm gonna be strong
Gotta get my fight on
Cause I know whose side I'm on
Got a heart like steel, a faith like gold
I'm gonna be bold

No more doubt
No more small and scared
I'm not broken beyond repair
No more fear
No more playing safe
I will not be chained

I'm gonna be bold
Gotta hold my head up
Cause I know when I get up
There's a victory I already hold
I'm gonna be strong
Gotta get my fight on
Cause I know whose side I'm on
Got a heart like steel, a faith like gold
I'm gonna be bold

I will not be chained
I'm gonna be bold
I will not be chained"
Iconic,Iconic,LEDGER,"You came in a flash of light
And my soul went weightless
You’re the perfect archetype
Raptured and captivated

Feel my heart begin to race
You take me to the place
That I've never known before
I hear the thunder roll
I hear the heavens call
I could never want it more

You are the spark, you set me on fire
You're so iconic, everything I wanted
You are my world, my legend, my star
You're so iconic, everybody wants it
You intoxicate me when you move
Look at the mess you make me
You are my world, my legend, my star
You're so iconic, everybody wants it

You came in a crash of bliss
It seems that fate has chained us
Embracing metamorphosis
As I give into your love

Oh, I hear you calling me
I can't help falling deep
Into your sweetness, your abyss
My heart begins to race
You take me to the place
I want it all and more of it

You are the spark, you set me on fire
You're so iconic, everything I wanted
You are my world, my legend, my star
You're so iconic, everybody wants it
You intoxicate me when you move
Look at the mess you make me
You are my world, my legend, my star
You're so iconic, everybody wants it

I hear the thunder roar
I hear the heavens call
I can never want it more
You intoxicate me when you move
Look at the mess you make me
Look at the mess you make me
So iconic, everybody wants it

You are the spark, you set me on fire
You're so iconic, everything I wanted
You are my world, my legend, my star
You're so iconic, everybody wants it
You intoxicate me when you move
Look at the mess you make me
You are my world, my legend, my star
You're so iconic, everybody wants it"
Completely,Completely,LEDGER,"You are the One, You are the One I need
You are the One who loves me completely

I don't have to hide when You're with me
The best, the worst, I know You'll never leave
It steals my breath away
When You lift my face and say
Who I was, who I am, and who I'll be
Has been claimed, I am Yours eternally

You are the One, You are the One I need
You are the One who loves me completely
In a world that's full of mysteries
One thing is simple as can be
You are the One who loves me completely

You're the One
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
You're the One
Oh oh oh oh oh oh

You have called new life up from the dust
Faithful even though I'd given up
You take the chaos that's in me
And You create a symphony
From who I was, who I am, and who I'll be
I am changed, I am Yours eternally

You are the One, You are the One I need
You are the One who loves me completely
In a world that's full of mysteries
One thing is simple as can be
You are the One who loves me completely

You're the One
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
You're the One
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
You're the One
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
You're the One
Oh oh oh oh oh oh

All I am is forever Yours
Everything I been livin' for
All I am is forever Yours
You have my heart, my soul

You are the One, You are the One I need (Ha-ah, ha-ah)
You are the One who loves me completely (Ha-ah)
In a world that's full of mysteries
One thing is simple as can be

Goner,Goner,LEDGER,"Just one touch
I'm changed, I'm fallin' in love
And You break into
My heart to make somethin' new

All of a sudden everything feels lighter
You stared into my soul and You desire
'Cause You're the only thing that takes me higher
Higher

I can't stop now
There's no way out
I'm a goner
I'm fallin' fast
I'm gonna crash
I'm a goner

I am captivated by Your treasure
And it'll be this way now and forever
I'm a gone, gone, goner
I'm a gone, gone, gone—
I'm a goner

Take it all
What I have has always been Yours
You're the one through and through
With flames that are only for You

All of a sudden I don't feel so hollow
No matter where You lead, I'm gonna follow
'Cause You're the only one that I wanna know
Wanna know

I can't stop now
There's no way out
I'm a goner
I'm fallin' fast
I'm gonna crash
I'm a goner

I am captivated by Your treasure
And it'll be this way now and forever
I'm a gone, gone, goner
I'm a gone, gone, gone—
I'm a goner


I can't stop now
There's no way out
I'm a goner

Countdown begins, can't keep my composure
'Bout to explode like a supernova
It's time I let my dreams and what's real collide
Five strikes to midnight
My guard is gone with you, I can't fake it
Losin' my cool, there's no savin' face here
It's time I left my filters and fears behind
Five strikes to midnight
Five strikes to midnight
Five strikes to midnight"
