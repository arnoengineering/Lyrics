Monster,Monster,Skillet,"The secret side of me I never let you see
I keep it caged but I can't control it
So stay away from me, the beast is ugly
I feel the rage and I just can't hold it
It's scratching on the walls, in the closet, in the halls
It comes awake and I can't control it
Hiding under the bed, in my body, in my head
Why won't somebody come and save me from this? Make it end

I feel it deep within, it's just beneath the skin
I must confess that I feel like a monster
I hate what I've become, the nightmare's just begun
I must confess that I feel like a monster
I, I feel like a monster
I, I feel like a monster

My secret side I keep hid under lock and key
I keep it caged but I can't control it
'Cause if I let him out, he'll tear me up, break me down
Why won't somebody come and save me from this? Make it end!

I feel it deep within, it's just beneath the skin
I must confess that I feel like a monster
I hate what I've become, the nightmare's just begun
I must confess that I feel like a monster
I feel it deep within, it's just beneath the skin
I must confess that I feel like a monster
I, I feel like a monster
I, I feel like a monster

It's hiding in the dark, its teeth are razor sharp
There's no escape for me, it wants my soul, it wants my heart
No one can hear me scream, 
maybe it's just a dream
Or maybe it's inside of me, stop this monster

I feel it deep within, it's just beneath the skin
I must confess that I 
feel like a monster
I hate what I've become, the nightmare's just begun
I must confess that I feel like a monster
I feel it deep within, it's just beneath the skin
I must confess that I feel like a monster
I’m gonna lose control, it’s something radical
I must confess that I feel like a monster
I, I feel like a monster
I, I feel like a monster
I, I feel like a monster
I, I feel like a monster"
Feel Invincible,Feel Invincible,Skillet,"Target on my back
Lone survivor lasts
They got me in their sights
No surrender no
Trigger fingers go
Living the dangerous life

Hey, hey, hey
Everyday when I wake
I'm trying to get up, they're knocking me down
Chewing me up, spitting me out
Hey, hey, hey
When I need to be saved
You're making me strong, you're making me stand
Never will fall, never will end
Shot like a rocket up into the sky
Nothing can stop me tonight

You make me feel invincible
Earthquake, powerful
Just like a tidal wave
You make me brave
You're my titanium
Fight song, raising up
Like a roar of victory in a stadium
Who can touch me cause I'm
I'm made of fire
Who can stop me tonight
I'm hard wired
You make me feel invincible

I feel, I feel it
Invincible
I feel, I feel it
Invincible

Here we go again
I will not give in
I've got a reason to fight
Every day we choose
We might win or lose
This is the dangerous life

Hey, hey, hey
Everyday when I wake
They say that I'm gone; they say that they've won
The bell has been rung, it's over and done
Hey, hey, hey
When I need to be saved
They counting me out, but this is my round
You in my corner, look at me now
Shot like a rocket up into the sky
Nothing can stop me tonight

You make me feel invincible
Earthquake, powerful
Just like a tidal wave
You make me brave
You're my titanium
Fight song, raising up
Like a roar of victory in a stadium
Who can touch me cause I'm

You make me feel invincible
You make me feel invincible
Shot like a rocket up into the sky
Not gonna stop
Invincible

Feel invincible
Earthquake, powerful
Just like a tidal wave
You make me brave
You're my titanium
Fight song, raising up
Like a roar of victory in a stadium

So feel invincible
Earthquake, powerful
Just like a tidal wave
You make me brave
You're my titanium
Fight song, raising up
Like a roar of victory in a stadium
Who can touch me cause I'm
I'm made of fire
Who can stop me tonight

The Resistance,The Resistance,Skillet,"(I) am a nation, (I) am a million faces
Formed together, made for elevation
(I) am a soldier, (I) won't surrender
Faith is like a fire that never burns to embers
(Who's gonna stand up, who's gonna fight?)
The voice of the unheard
(Who's gonna break these chains and lies?)
Love is the answer
I gotta speak it, believe it, that's how I feel inside
I, I, can't, can't sit here quiet

You can take my heart, you can take my breath
When you pry it from my cold, dead chest

This is how we rise up
Heavy as a hurricane, louder than a freight train
This is how we rise up
Heart is beating faster, feels like thunder
Magic, static, call me a fanatic
It's our world, they can never have it
This is how we rise up
It's our resistance, you can't resist us

(Hey) Can you hear me? (Hey) Are you listening?
Sleeping in the shadows, could be making history
(Walk) through the fire, (Walk) on the water
Used to be a slave, but now you are a conqueror

They can take my heart, they can take my breath
When they pry it from my cold, dead chest

This is how we rise up
Heavy as a hurricane, louder than a freight train
This is how we rise up
Heart is beating faster, feels like thunder
Magic, static, call me a fanatic
It's our world, they can never have it
This is how we rise up
It's our resistance, you can't resist us

Rising up, up, up, up, up
We're rising up, up, up, up, up
The voice of the unheard
Rising up, up, up, up, up
We're rising up, up, up, up, up
Love is the answer
Rising up, up, up, up, up
We're rising up, up, up, up, up
Love is the answer
This is how we rise up
It's our resistance, you can't resist us

This is how we rise up
Heavy as a hurricane, louder than a freight train
This is how we rise up
Heart is beating faster, feels like thunder
Magic, static, call me a fanatic
It's our world, they can never have it
This is how we rise up
It's our resistance, you can't resist us"

I'm just a step away, I'm just a breath away
Losin' my faith today, 
we're fallin' off the edge today
I am just a man, not superhuman

Comatose,Comatose,Skillet,"I hate feeling like this
I'm so tired of trying to fight this
I'm asleep and all I dream of
Is waking to you
Tell me that you will listen
Your touch is what I'm missing
And the more I hide I realize I'm slowly losing you

Comatose
I'll never wake up without an overdose of you

I don't want to live
I don't want to breathe
'Less I feel you next to me
You take the pain I feel
(Waking up to you never felt so real)
I don't want to sleep
I don't want to dream
Cause my dreams don't comfort me
The way you make me feel
(Waking up to you never felt so real)

I hate living without you
Dead wrong to ever doubt you
But my demons lay in waiting
Tempting me away
Oh, how I adore you
Oh, how I thirst for you
Oh, how I need you

Comatose
I'll never wake up without an overdose of you

I don't want to live
I don't want to breathe
'Less I feel you next to me
You take the pain I feel

I don't want to sleep
I don't want to dream
Cause my dreams don't comfort me
The way you make me feel

Breathing life
Waking up

Stars,Stars,Skillet,"You spoke a word and life began
Told oceans where to start and where to end
You set in motion time and space
But still you come and you call to me by name
But still you come and you call to me by name

If you can hold the stars in place
You can hold my heart the same
Whenever I fall away
Whenever I start to break
So here I am, lifting up my heart
To the one who holds the stars

The deepest depths, the darkest nights
Can't separate, can't keep me from your sight
I get so lost, forget my way
But still you love and you don't forget my name

If you can hold the stars in place
You can hold my heart the same
Whenever I fall away
Whenever I start to break
So here I am, lifting up my heart
If you can calm the raging sea
You can calm the storm in me
You're never too far away
You never show up too late
So here I am, lifting up my heart
To the one who holds the stars

Your love has called my name
What do I have to fear?
What do I have to fear?
Your love has called my name
What do I have to fear?
What do I have to fear?

If you can hold the stars in place
You can hold my heart the same
Whenever I fall away
Whenever I start to break
So here I am, lifting up my heart

If you can calm the raging sea
You can calm the storm in me

Awake and Alive,Awake and Alive,Skillet,"I'm at war with the world and they

No matter what I can't be bought or sold
When my faith is getting weak
And I feel like giving in

Not Gonna Die,Not Gonna Die,Skillet,"Death surrounds
My heartbeat’s slowing down
I won’t take this world’s abuse
I won’t give up, I refuse
This is how it feels when you’re bent and broken
This is how it feels when your dignity’s stolen
When everything you love is leaving
You hold on to what you believe in

The last thing I heard was you whispering goodbye
And then I heard you flatline

Jen Ledger

No, not gonna die tonight
We're gonna stand and fight forever
Don’t close your eyes
No, not gonna die tonight
We're gonna fight for us together
No, we’re not gonna die tonight

Break their hold
Because I won’t be controlled
They can’t keep their chains on me
When the truth has set me free
This is how it feels when you take your life back
This is how it feels when you finally fight back
When life pushes me I push harder
What doesn't kill me makes me stronger

The last thing I heard was you whispering goodbye
And then I heard you flatline

 Kids, get under the table! Kids get under the table!!!
 We are getting new reports from all around the globe, showing the highest unemployment rates since the end of World War II. Many are losing their jobs, their homes, and in many cases, their hope

When I'm dead and gone
I just wanna be the one who
Got up and came back strong
[Chorus: John Cooper & 
Jen Ledger

High above it all (
Above it all
)
Victorious, victorious
Far too long I've crawled (
Far too long
)
In hopelessness, I'm over this
Don't give up on me (
Don't give up on me
)
Tell me you believe (
Tell me you believe
)
I can face it all (
Face it all
)
Victorious, victorious

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

Help me 'cause I'm falling
When I can't sleep, but I'm holding on
Can't face this night alone

In all this loneliness and all this emptiness
Been stuck inside this room like a prison sentence
I'm not gonna stay
Tell me there's a way
[Chorus: John Cooper & 
Jen Ledger

High above it all (
Above it all

Victorious, victorious
Far too long I've crawled (
Far too long

In hopelessness, I'm over this
Don't give up on me (
Don't give up on me

Tell me you believe (
Tell me you believe

Undefeated,Undefeated,Skillet,"I'm undefeated

Hands on my neck, foot on my back
Closing in from every side
Bleeding me dry, I'm fading fast

Left for dead but I will rise up on my own
I could make it alone, I got all that I need to survive
(All that I need to survive)
Through the sweat and the blood, I know what I'm made of
It's the hunger that keeps me alive
(Keeps me alive)
This time, I'm coming like a hurricane, this time

I came to fight for the love of the game, unstoppable
That's why I, I'm undefeated
Off the leash, out of the cage, an animal
That's why I, I'm undefeated
I, I, I know I can beat it
Won't give up 'cause I believe it
Fight for the love of the game, unstoppable
That's why I, I'm undefeated

Here at the edge losing my ground
Stare into the great divide
Pushing me over, pulling me down

Almost dead, but I will rise up on my own
No, I'm never alone and it's all that I need to survive
(All that I need to survive)
Through the sweat and the blood, if I fall, I'll get up
It's the hunger that keeps me alive
(Keeps me alive)
This time, I'm coming like a hurricane, this time

I came to fight for the love of the game, unstoppable
That's why I, I'm undefeated
Off the leash, out of the cage, an animal

I, I, I know I can beat it
Won't give up 'cause I believe it
Fight for the love of the game, unstoppable
That's why I, I'm undefeated

All the strength that I have, all the life that's left in me
I will give every breath to be everything I can be
I, I, I'm undefeated
I, I, I'm undefeated

I came to fight for the love of the game, unstoppable
That's why I, I'm undefeated

I need you because no one else
Can get me out, get me out of Hell?

I've been stabbed in the back, the bleeding won't stop
Just another cut in the dark

It's not too late for broken hearts
Take my hand, make a wish on a star

You were a comet and I lost it
Watching for comets, will I see you again?
Everybody needs someone but they can't feel like this
How can I breathe with this burning in my chest?
You were gone so fast, I want you back
You were a comet and I lost it
Time to spread my wings and fly
Watching for comets, will I see you again?
Time to fly away so high

Now I see you, I'm frozen in time
All your colors burst into life
I don't dare close my eyes
Cause a love like this happens once in a lifetime

You were a comet and I lost it
Watching for comets, will I see you again?

We are kings and conquerors
And I won't bow to you

We will not conform, no, anymore
We are the saviors, the saviors

Cities will burn, the end is come
Paradise is lost, we wonder what we've done

Riches rust
The iron fist crashes down on the powerless
But hope could live again if we can find ourselves

Rebirthing,Rebirthing,Skillet,"I lie here paralytic
Inside this soul
Screaming for you till my throat is numb
I wanna break out, I need a way out
I don't believe that it's gotta be this way
The worst is the waiting
In this womb I'm suffocating

Feel your presence filling up my lungs with oxygen
I take you in
I've died

Rebirthing now
I want to live for love, wanna live for you and me
Breathe for the first time now
I come alive somehow
Rebirthing now
I want to live my life, wanna give you everything
Breathe for the first time now
I come alive somehow
Right now
Right now

I lie here lifeless
In this cocoon
Shedding my skin 'cause
I'm ready to
I want to break out
I found a way out
I don't believe that it's gotta be this way
The worst is the waiting
In this womb I'm suffocating

Tell me when I'm going to live again
Tell me when I'm going to breathe you in
Tell me when I'm going to feel inside
Tell me when I'm going to feel alive
Tell me when I'm going to live again
Tell me when this fear will end
Tell me when I'm going to feel inside
Tell me when I'll feel alive

You can hold my heart the same
Whenever I fall away
Whenever I start to break
So here I am, lifting up my heart
To the One who holds the stars

The deepest depths, the darkest nights
Can't separate, can't keep me from your sight
I get so lost, forget my way

You never show up too late

Death death death death death
Death surrounds me, singing to me softly

This is how it feels when your dignity's stolen

It's like a movie playing over in my head
Don't want to look because i know how it ends
All the words that I said that I wouldn't say
All the promises I made that I wouldn't break
It's last call, last song, last dance
Because I can't get you back, can't get a second chance


Don't wake me
Because I don't want to leave this dream
Don't wake me
Because I never seem to stay asleep enough

Don't wake me
We're together just you and me
Don't wake me
Because we're happy like we used to be
I know I've got to let you go
But I don't want to be alone

These dreams of you keep on growing stronger
It ain't a lot but it's all I have
Nothing to do but keep sleeping longer
Don't want to stop cause I want you back

Those Nights,Those Nights,Skillet,"I remember when we used to laugh
About nothing at all
It was better than going mad
From trying to solve all the problems we're going through
Forget them all
Cause on those nights
We would stand and never fall
Together we faced it all
Remember when we'd

Stay up late and we'd talk all night
In a dark room lit by the TV light
Through all the hard times in my life
Those nights kept me alive
We'd listen to the radio play all night
Didn't wanna go home to another fight
Through all the hard times in my life
Those nights kept me alive

I remember when we used to drive
Anywhere but here
As long as we'd forget our lives
We were so young and confused
That we didn't know to laugh or cry
Those nights were ours
They will live and never die
Together we'd stand forever
Remember when we'd

Stay up late and we'd talk all night
In a dark room lit by the TV light
Through all the hard times in my life
Those nights kept me alive
We'd listen to the radio play all night
Didn't wanna go home to another fight
Through all the hard times in my life
Those nights kept me alive

Those nights belong to us
There's nothing wrong with us
Those nights belong to us
I remember when
We used to laugh
And now I wish those nights would last

Stay up late and we'd talk all night
In a dark room lit by the TV light
Through all the hard times in my life
Those nights kept me alive
We'd listen to the radio play all night
Didn't wanna go home to another fight
Through all the hard times in my life
Those nights kept me alive
Stay up late and we'd talk all night
In a dark room lit by the TV light
Through all the hard times in my life
Those nights kept me alive
We'd listen to the radio play all night
Didn't wanna go home to another fight
Through all the hard times in my life

All the chances that have passed me by
Would it matter if I gave it one more try?
Would it matter at all?

I know I'm a mess and I wanna be someone
Someone that I like better
Can you help me forget?
Don't wanna feel like this forever
Forever!

What if I just pulled myself together?
Would it matter at all?
What if I just tried not to remember?
Would it matter at all?
All the chances that have passed me by
Would it matter if I gave it one more try?
Would it matter at all?

If I left tomorrow
Would anybody care?
Stuck in this sorrow
Going nowhere

All the chances that have passed me by
Would it matter if I gave it one more try?
Would it matter at all?"

The Older I Get,The Older I Get,Skillet,"The walls between
You and I
Always pushing us apart nothing left but scars fight after fight
The space between
Our calm and rage
Started growing shorter , disappearing slowly day after day

I was sitting there waiting in my room for you
You were waiting for me too
And it makes me wonder

The older I get
Will I get over it
It's been way too long for the times we missed
I didn't know then it would hurt like this but I think
The older I get
Maybe I'll get over it
It's been way too long for the times we missed
I can't believe it still hurts like this

The time between
Those cutting words
Built up our defenses never made no sense it just made me hurt
Do you believe
That time heals all wounds
It started getting better but it's easy not to fight when I'm not with you

I was sitting there waiting in my room for you
You were waiting for me too
And it makes me wonder

I should've weathered the storm

Keep holdin' on, I'm holdin' on
Callin' Your name 'til I find my way out
Night is so long, I'll wait for the dawn

Can't stop these visions of what life could be
I'm taking back what I lost, lost
Starlight and colors are bursting in me
This is the place I belong

Dream of a world still yet to come
Whispers of love callin' me home
To Eden (Eden)

This is our chance to live like we're free

The fear will never find you
Take up, take up the love
And let it guide you home
Take me to Eden

All comes clear
We're waitin' for Heaven
But Heaven is here

Dream of a world still yet to come
Whispers of love callin' me home

Say Goodbye,Say Goodbye,Skillet,"Things are changing
It seems strange and
I need to figure this out
You've got your life
I got mine
But you're all I cared about
Yesterday we were laughing
Today I'm left here asking
Where has all the time gone now
I'm left alone somehow
Growing up and getting older
I don't want to believe it's over

Don't say goodbye
'Cause I don't wanna hear those words tonight
'Cause maybe it's not the end for you and I
And although we knew
This time would come for me and you
Don't say anything tonight
If you're gonna say goodbye

Do you remember
In December
How we swore we'd never change
Even though you're leaving
That our feelings
Would always stay the same
I wish we could be laughing
Instead I'm standing here asking
Do we have to end this now
Can we make it last somehow
We both know what we've got to say, not today
Because I don't want to leave this way

Don't say goodbye
'Cause I don't wanna hear those words tonight
'Cause maybe it's not the end for you and I
And although we knew
This time would come for me and you
Don't say anything tonight
If you're gonna say goodbye

And if it's over
It hurts but I'm giving you my word
I hope that you're always
Happy like we were
Happy like we were

Don't say goodbye
'Cause I don't wanna hear those words tonight
'Cause maybe it's not the end for you and I
And although we knew
This time would come for me and you
Don't say anything tonight
If you're gonna say goodbye

Yesterday we were laughing (if you're going to say goodbye)
Today I'm left here asking (if you're going to say goodbye)
And although we knew this time would come for me and you
Don't say anything tonight

American Noise,American Noise,Skillet,"Angry words and honking cars
Satellites and falling stars
Distant dark blue radios that whisper down my boulevards
Ghosts and chains rattle in the attic
Broken headphones filled with static
Lonely room you’ve got nowhere to run
Three, two
One for all and all for one

Times will be bad, times will be good
Things I wish I hadn’t done and some I wish I would
Cutting through the American noise
You’ve got a voice and a song to sing (And a song to sing)
Drink deep in the morning
Drink deep in the morning
See what the day will bring

La da da da
Lift up your voice
Let love cut through the American noise
La da da da
Lift up your voice
Let love cut through the American noise

Slamming doors and cell phone rings
Hurricane force of silent screams
Don’t know what to believe
Bend the rule just to break it
You're so tired because you've got to fake it
But you just want to be someone
Three, two
One for all and all for one

Times will be bad, times will be good
Things I wish I hadn’t done and some I wish I would

Why don’t you use it?
Sing your own song take all the noise
And make it into music

Looking for Angels,Looking for Angels,Skillet,"Going through this life looking for angels
People passing by, looking for angels

Walk this world alone try to stay on my feet
Sometimes crawl, fall, but I stand up cause I'm afraid to sleep
And open my eyes to a new day, with all new problems and all new pain
All the faces are filled with so much anger
Losing our dignity and hope from fear of danger
After all the wars, after settling the scores
At the break of dawn we will be deaf to the answers
There's so much bigotry, misunderstanding and fear
With eyes squinted and fists clinched we reach out for what is dear
(We want it, we want
We want a reason to live)
We're on a pilgrimage
A crusade for hope
Because in our hearts and minds and souls we know
(We need it, we need
We need more than this)

Going through this life looking for angels
People passing by, looking for angels
Walking down the streets looking for angels
Everyone I meet looking for angels

So many nations with so many hungry people
So many homeless scrounging around for dirty needles
On the rise, teen suicide, when we will realize
We've been desensitized by the lies of the world
We're oppressed and impressed by the greedy
Whose hands squeeze the life out of the needy
When will we learn that wars, threats, and regrets
Are the cause and effect of living in fear
Who can help protect the innocence of our children
Stolen on the internet with images they can't forget
(We want it, we want
We want a reason to live)
We represent a generation that wants to turn back a nation
To let love be our light and salvation
(We need it, we need
We need more than this)

Going through this life looking for angels
People passing by, looking for angels
Walking down the streets looking for angels
Everyone I meet looking for angels

I became a savior to some kids I'll never meet
Sent a check in the mail to buy them something to eat
What will you do to make a difference, to make a change?
What will you do to help someone along the way?
Just a touch, a smile as you turn the other cheek
Pray for your enemies, humble yourself, love's staring back at me
In the midst of the most painful faces
Angels show up in the strangest of places

Going through this life looking for angels
People passing by, looking for angels
Walking down the streets looking for angels
Everyone I meet looking for angels
Going through this life looking for angels
People passing by, looking for angels
Walking down the streets looking for angels
Everyone I meet looking for angels
Going through this life looking for angels
People passing by, looking for angels
Walking down the streets looking for angels
Everyone I meet looking for angels"

Its teeth are razor sharp
There's no escape for me
It wants my soul, it wants my heart
No one can hear me scream
Maybe it's just a dream
Maybe it's inside of me

I feel it deep within
It's just beneath the skin
I must confess that I
Feel like a monster
I hate what I've become
The nightmare's just begun
I must confess that I feel like a monster

To put the past finally behind me
And hope to make it through another night

You are my light when faith is hard to find
When faith is hard to find
Will you still hold on

Something woke me in the night
In the midst of the darkness, I recognize the light
Now inside me, the picture seems so clear
All the dying in my broken dreams is starting to appear

Will I stand or will I fall?

I am just as dead leaves fall

Safe with you
Safe with you

Chaos in my head
The whole universe is at rest
When I am in your arms
Is when I feel the best
Locked inside your creative being
Whirling about your unfailing truth
Attacked with power by ferocious love
Salvation alone belongs to you

Safe with you
Safe with you

Lifting up my voice
To the God who really sees
The God who is consumed
With loving thoughts of me
The screaming winds
And the crashing of the oceans
Shifting sands and the changing of the seasons
As I stand in awe and wonder
Nothing in the world has prepared me for you

Jesus, Jesus, I am safe with you"

Because Your voice heals me inside
Because my soul is satisfied
Because Your love keeps me alive

You could take my heart and put it in a padlocked box
What if they grab too hard or smash it, or throw it down
I am scared of being hurt, I just want to live, live a happy life!

You want to, you want to
Soak my heart in gasoline
Light a match and consume me
Soak my pride in gasoline all of you and none of me

I was reminded my heart reeks of gasoline
It bears the mark of a slave committed to life
Anyone who wants it
Will have to grab it from a real big God try to touch me
You will be consumed, you¬ will be consumed I want to, I want to

You gave us shad and light
You create mood and substance
How can I can take a bite?

Paint me open eyes, Paint me with the color of love
Paint me, mark me up
In these frail, dot-to-dot lines
Color me from one red stream
From which all others flow

Last Day Of Summer,Last Day Of Summer,Skillet,"Storm clouds rush the shore
Ocean fills with tears
Life speeds up, time rolls by
Minutes measure up to years

Sun breaks through the clouds
Blinking briefly on the bay
Casting diamonds here and there
Just before it slips away

The last day of Summer
Drifts out on the wind
Never returning
Still it's not the end
It's just the last day of Summer
Wake up from the dream
Life goes on until it's gone
Night is never empty as it seems

As the shadows fall
Somewhere someone lights a fire
Dancing like a distant sun
Like a walker on a wire

The last day of Summer
Drifts out on the wind
Never returning
Still it's not the end
It's just the last day of Summer
Wake up from the dream
Life goes on until it's gone
Night is never empty as it seems

Sunset has no hidden meaning
Only beauty, silent as time
Melting slowly into the sea
As stars like angels rise and shine

The last day of Summer
Drifts out on the wind
Never returning
Still it's not the end
It's just the last day of Summer
Wake up from the dream
Life goes on until it's gone
Night is never empty as it

The last day of Summer
Drifts out on the wind
Never returning
Still it's not the end
It's just the last day of Summer
Wake up from the dream
Life goes on until it's gone
Night is never empty as it seems
Empty as it seems"

We must hold on to our faith in each other
We must let go of our pain, yeah I say
We must hold on to our faith in each other
Got to still believe in each other

Time is short to live the life

Strength to rise one more time
Could you stand? Could you stand? Hey, hey

Scarecrow,Scarecrow,Skillet,"Hanging on a post
In my dirty clothes
Try to concentrate on You
But I keep forgetting

Safe enough to not let go
Scared enough to not release
Open up to drink the wind
You tear me up when you come in

Take me down, shake me out
Give me a brain, that I might know You better
Take me down, shake me out
Give me a brain, that I might know You better

Hanging in the sun
Waiting for the rain
Saw a field catch on fire
I caught myself just watching

Safe enough to not let go
Scared enough to not release
Open up to drink the wind
You tear me up when you come in

Take me down, shake me out
Give me a heart, that I might love You better
Take me down, shake me out
Give me a heart, that I might love You better

Hanging on a post
Just next to Yours
I want to curse and spit
I weep aloud at Your mercy

Take me down, shake me out
Give me a life, that I might serve You better
Take me down, shake me out
Give me a life, that I might serve You better
Take me down, shake me out
Give me a life, that I might serve You better
Take me down, shake me out
Give me a life, that I might serve You better
Take me down, shake me out

Splinter,Splinter,Skillet,"Here I lie again inside this broken body
Wrestle against the tree, my muscles aching
To get up now is death, to die is to really live
Flesh is restless, twisting, spasms in my back increasing

Splinter me, splinter me
My heart, my head
Splinter me

Here I think again to try to solve this puzzle
What is not yours I do not want, my mind aching
To reconstruct my thoughts or let it blow away
You are all-knowing, changing, yeah you arekilling me

Splinter me, splinter me
My heart, my head
Splinter me

Jesus whispered softly, Jesus shouted it out
His kingdom body coming
But we nail him up and hate each other

Splinter me, splinter me
My broken body
Splinter me
Splinter me, splinter me
My broken body
Splinter me"

To strength out of weak (ya-di-da-da-da)

Not by what I can keep
Exposed before You

I hide myself in you
Shaking of our lives
Strength, with strength we rise
Anchored in you
Nothing shakes you
Nothing shakes you down

You never change
Always the same, always the same, always the same

Spinning, spinning, the whole world just spins around
People to people all trying just to figure out
Moving, moving, where's the power to slow it down
Staying, standing, standing on this strength I've found

Division's coming down
I saw peace on a white horse riding
Love is spreading around
The most contagious disease we've ever known

I will drink from the well of the One who gives me life
I will eat of the bread of the One sacrifice
I will breathe of the breath of the body of God
I will dive to the depths and I will raise a new man

Racism's coming down
Not from the law but a change in perception
Revival's spreading around
I hear the sound of reapers already say

I will drink from the well of the One who gives me life
I will eat of the bread of the One sacrifice
I will breathe of the breath of the body of God
I will dive to the depths and I will raise a new man

Our knees are going down
To the One who brings fear to my every bone
His Kingdom's reigning down
Who can stop the plans of the Lord I say

I will drink from the well of the One who gives me life
I will eat of the bread of the One sacrifice
I will breathe of the breath of the body of God

Thought You'd push me into a clump
Make me smaller than I was before
Though You would press me and mold me
Took a step and felt the pressure on
Exploding me into open space

Now You pull me apart
I'm suspended in You
Stretch me bigger
Reveal Yourself to be
The frame that holds me tightly in center
Pulled into suspension in the middle of You

Let what was hidden be revealed
Walls of fear broken wide
Infinite Jesus spread all in You
Towering over the horizons
Stretching to the horizons
Gushing with surrender in Your hands

Now You pull me apart

Stretch me bigger

Disappearing slowly day after day

You were waiting for me too
And it makes me wonder
The older I get
Will I get over it?

I didn't know then it would hurt like this but I think
The older I get
Maybe I'll get over it
It's been way too long for the times we missed
I can't believe it still hurts like this
The time between those cutting words
Built up our defenses
Never made no sense it just made me hurt
Do you believe that time heals all wounds?
It started getting better
But it's easy not to fight when I'm not with you
I was sitting there waiting in my room for you
You were waiting for me too
And it makes me wonder
What was I waiting for
I should've taken less and given you more
I should've weathered the storm
I need to say so bad
What were you waiting for?
This could have been the best we ever had

The hurt and the broken find rest here
I saw angels fall down
At the beauty of the Lord

You cause a smile and the teardrops in my eye

Walkin' 'side Your every movement
Will I stand or will I fall?
Trapped inside Your walls of glory
I am just as a deadly scrawl, yeah

Will I send my head but the universe is at rest?
When I'm in Your arms is when I feel the best

Locked inside Your creative being
World about in Your unfailing truth
Attacked with power by ferocious love
Salvation alone belongs to You

It belongs to You, yeah yeah

You take up my voice
To the God Who really sees
The God Who is consumed
With only thoughts of me

The screaming wind and the crashing of the oceans
Shifting sands and the changing of seasons
As I stand in awe and wonder
Nothing in the world has prepared me for You

It has prepared me for You

Jesus
I'll be safe with You
Jesus, Jesus
I'll be safe with You
Jesus
I'm safe, I'm safe, I'm safe
Jesus
I'm safe"
Smile Again,Smile Again,Skillet,"Lyrics From Snippet

Leavin'
You are here for a while
I know we smile but then

Prayin’
Even though I don't believe
But you've come back to us again

Can you look at yourself
When all you see is everything you left when you abandoned me?
Can you live with yourself
When you know you left me bleedin’, left me needin'
When all I wanted was a smile again?"
