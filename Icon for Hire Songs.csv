Under The Knife,Under The Knife,Icon For Hire,"This is the song I’m too scared to write
But some of you may need it tonight

Oh there you were, heart made of glass
Fragile little thing, shattered too fast
Tried to pick the pieces up up up
And that’s the way you first got cut cut cut
Devil drew you in, you didn’t let it show
Didn’t want the others to ever have to know
That you were getting hooked on up up up
And all you had to do was cut cut cut

You carved a special place for your pain
So it came back to hurt you every night
You closed your eyes and wished it all away
Until you disappeared under the knife

You knew the deal, no one gives a damn
Just another needy kid, sob story in hand
Keep your secrets covered up up up
We don’t need another cut cut cut
But you couldn’t hide a heart made of glass
You put yourself together with all the strength you had
You were finally fed up up up
Finally had to scream enough

You carved a special place for your pain
So it came back to hurt you every night
You closed your eyes and wished it all away
Until you disappeared under the knife

Listen- I know it’s simplified from the other side
It’s easy to gloss over all the messy reasons why
And it’s easy to forget where you’ve been
I guess that’s what the scars are for, huh?
When we were 15 we wouldn’t dare let that shit be seen
But now it seems mutalation’s gone mainstream
I see you at my shows, scarred up from head to toe
Like there’s no point even trying not to let it show
Cause we all know, emo kids like to hurt themselves
Too many feelings and not enough self control
And I mean, does this mess any of the rest of you
It’s an epidemic and we’re cool with it, don’t question it
But it bothers me, our scars are currency by which we’re measured
Like let the record show who let it slip and who held it together
Cutters and burners and honorable mentions
Posers who still cut themselves up for the attention

I don’t care your intentions, I just want you to know
My self-hatred never took me where I wanted to go
And at the end of the day, you know I still had to face
That I can pick at the pain, but can’t cut it away
And you know what else I can’t do is give you ten good reasons not to
I’ve racked my brain for clever sayings of all the things you ought to do
But you know, I think if there was something I could say
They’d have thrown it on a brochure- and sent you on your way
So I’ll keep doing what I always do: drag my heart to the piano and make it sing for you
I’ll keep doing what I always do: drag my heart to the piano and let it sing for you

Drag my heart to the piano and let it sing for you"
Make A Move,Make A Move,Icon For Hire,"Somebody make a move
Somebody make a move
Please somebody

Test my reality
Check if there's a weak spot
Clingin' to insanity
In hopes the world will ease up
Try to make it look like it's all somehow getting better
'Cause I know how to play it pretty good against the measure
Everyone started out a little insane
But we learn pretty quick how to fake it for the game
But some of you never learned to drop the act
So under that skin of yours: a heart attack

'Cause everybody's so scared
We don't wanna go there
We don't wanna make a move
We got all our lives to lose
Screaming in the dark while we just play our part out
I play along
Like I don't know what's going on
Somebody make a move
Somebody make a move
Please somebody make a move
We all know
We all know what's going on

And if I had the answers I'd have written them out
So I can tell you what to do and what this thing is about
But all I've ever learned comes second-hand
And I dare not preach what I don't understand

You and I; we share the same disease
Cover up; compromise what we grieve
I've let more than my share of revivals die
This isn't pretty but it's what I am tonight

'Cause everybody's so scared
We don't wanna go there
We don't wanna make a move
We got all our lives to lose
Screaming in the dark while we just play our part out
I play along
Like I don't know what's going on
Somebody make a move
Somebody make a move
Please somebody make a move
We all know
We all know what's going on

Pointing my fingers the problems still linger
They keep getting bigger and I hold the trigger
Running with fire, I live like a liar
Please somebody make a move
Somebody make a move (I'm pointing my fingers)
Somebody make a move (The problems still linger)
Somebody make a move (I'm pointing my fingers)
Somebody
Somebody make a move

'Cause everybody's so scared
We don't wanna go there
We don't wanna make a move
Screaming in the dark while we just play our part out
I play along
'Cause everybody's so scared
We don't wanna go there
We don't wanna make a move
We got all our lives to lose
Screaming in the dark while we just play our part out
I play along
Like I don't know what's going on
Somebody make a move
Somebody make a move
Please somebody make a move
We all know
We all know what's going on"
Off With Her Head,Off With Her Head,Icon For Hire,"I'm lucky if I ever see the light of day again
My skin is choking me, my feeble walls are closing in
This cell is filled with scholars easing me, they're teasing me
They told me ""so, I didn't know the fall would be this easy""

How long until it starts to do me in?
I can't give out what I'm not breathing in
I know, they'll come with what I'm owed, guilty as charged
My enemies belittle me reminding me the penalty of all my deeds, despite my pleas, is death

Don't let go, cause
I don't wanna be this, I don't wanna be this
Death is mine, I know
Don't let go, don't let go
Save your own, cause, I don't wanna be this, I don't wanna be this
Death is mine, I know
Don't let go, don't let go, savior

Your way to life has only shown me what a fool I am
It serves the purpose of confirming I remain condemned
And I will ever linger on the edge
Unless you hear me

How long until it starts to do me in?
I can't give out what I'm not breathing in
I know, they'll come with what I'm owed, guilty as charged
My enemies belittle me reminding me the penalty of all my deeds, despite my pleas, is death


Don't let go, cause
I don't wanna be this, I don't wanna be this
Death is mine, I know
Don't let go, don't let go
Save your own, cause, I don't wanna be this, I don't wanna be this
Death is mine, I know
Don't let go, don't let go, save your own"
Hope of Morning,Hope of Morning,Icon For Hire,"My mind's a kaleidoscope, it thinks too fast
Blurs all the colors 'til I can't see past
The last mistake, the choice I made
Staring in the mirror with myself to blame
Sometimes I'm afraid of the thoughts inside
Nowhere to hide inside my mind
I'm scared that you'll compare and I'll look a lifetime past repair
I second guess myself to death, I re-solicit every step
What if my words are meaningless? What if my heart's misleading this?
I try to capture every moment as it comes to me
Bottle up the memories and let them keep me company

When the hope of morning starts to fade in me
I don't dare let darkness have its way with me
And the hope of morning makes me worth the fight
I will not be giving in tonight

When I'm old and grey, or thirty, or whatever happens first
I'll need you to reassure me I didn't waste a verse
Or worse, what if my life's work is reduced to just myself
Like never let you get a word in, while I dissect my mental health
Or lack thereof, whatever, there's too many things to track
I really can't remember if I'm insane or insomniac
Now days, all the kids want crazy, wanna diagnose themselves
Trade up made up epidemics, pass around prescription pills
But my disorder can't be cured by a bottle, blade, or dose
Self-disgust and selfishness tend to hold me awfully close
But I don't wanna let you see that, I don't want my friends to know
Self-disgust and selfishness take me everywhere I go

When the hope of morning starts to fade in me
I don't dare let darkness have its way with me
And the hope of morning makes me worth the fight
I will not be giving in tonight

Try as I might to keep it together
Why is recovery taking forever?
Fool the whole world, just until I get better
I'm terrified I'll be faking forever
(Faking forever)
On and on I wonder what went wrong inside my head
I don't have to have the answers, but tonight I wish I did
All the pain I can't explain away won't fade
All the the secrets silenced by the shame
Don't make me say it
Don't make me say it
Don't make me say it
Don't make me say it
Don't make me say it
Don't make me say it
Don't make me say it

When the hope of morning starts to fade in me
I don't dare let darkness have its way with me
And the hope of morning makes me worth the fight
I will not be giving in tonight"
Now You Know,Now You Know,Icon For Hire,"Seem like everywhere I go, everybody wanna know
""What's it like to be a girl, in the music world?""

The scene is so sexist, believe me I get it, we'd probably sell more records if I flaunted my ass and chest but forget it
I work like one of the boys, and I'm as true as they get
But I'm a lady through and through, like give me some credit
I knew I'd regret it if I tried to blend in and pretend
Be something other than I am
Like have you noticed I'm a woman
Didn't come to downplay it, or to play it up either
And I'm not trying pick a fight or be nobody's leader
But it feels like everybody's just a little too interested
In the fact that females can indeed make music
Our interviews, our bios, - they all make it a point
""Female Fronted Band, from Decatur, Illinois""
And just once, I'd like to see some other band's resumé go out of their way to say they're fronted by a male, ok?
And while we're on it, let me say
Women don't all sound the same
Who gave us the idea that ""Female Fronted” is a genre anyway?

Seem like everywhere I go, everybody wanna know
""What's it like to be a girl, in the music world?""
Wanna make it disappear, tell 'em what they wanna hear
If truth ain't pretty will you all stay with me
Will you love me, love me ugly?

And I know it's not fair, and I can't complain
Cuz with a girl in our band, people don’t look away
But you know what, it feels like they look just a little too long
Stare me up and down, forget to listen to the song
I take the stage and before I even open my mouth, the audience assumes that they got us all figured out
""Oh your band's got a chick, must be some kinda trick
There's no way she got this far without sucking somebody's...""
Did you really think that's how it works, I'm not fucking eye candy
I'm here to do my job, I'll be the last man standing
Boys in crowd asking, for me to flash them, well here you go, news flash:
You're ignorant and that's that
I bet you'd never say that to your little sister
The media's got you all jacked up, little mister
Cuz girls in my position can perpetuate the cycle
Walking a tightrope, don't know which way to go
Hypersexualize, or downplay your femininity
Dress like the dudes, or pray to God that you're pretty
Are you kidding me? And I don't even know who's to blame
Beauty sells, I buy it too, I'm trying to sell it back it you

Seem like everywhere I go, everybody wanna know
What's it like to be a girl, in the music world
Wanna make it disappear, tell 'em what they wanna hear
If truth ain't pretty will you all stay with me
Will you love me, love me ugly?

So tell me, what's a woman to do--no, scratch that
Tell me what's a human being to do with the fact that
What gets us ahead holds us back more
Isn't a level playing field too much to ask for?
And I know that by saying it, I'm bringing attention
To an issue that might be better left unmentioned -
But someone's gotta say it, gotta call out the scene
The scene is obscene, my sanity's split at the seams
So to all of ya'll making this just about ass and tits
Here to set the record straight, it don't gotta be this way
We can change the game, rearrange the way to fame
And make a bigger deal about the talent than the face
See I got little girls watching me, wanting to be like me
And I wanna show them that they don't gotta be like me
They can do their own thing, they can rewrite the rules
They can get respect without acting like fools
So let's not make it harder than it has to be
I'll keep making music, you stop asking me
""What's it like to be a girl in the entertainment world?""
Cuz now you know

Seem like everywhere I go, everybody wanna know
""What's it like to be a girl, in the music world?""
Wanna make it disappear, tell 'em what they wanna hear
If truth ain't pretty will you all stay with me
Will you love me, love me ugly?
Seem like everywhere I go, everybody wanna know
""What's it like to be a girl, in the music world?""
Wanna make it disappear, tell 'em what they wanna hear
If truth ain't pretty will you all stay with me
Will you love me, love me ugly?"
The Grey,The Grey,Icon For Hire,"I am standing on the edge of returning or just running away
I am letting myself look the other way
And the hardest part in all of this is
I don't think I know my way back home
Is it worth the journey, or do I let my heart settle here?

How cold have I become?
I  didn't want to
Lose you by what I'd done
Caught in the grey

I don't want to look you in the eyes, you might call me away
I don't want to give you the chance to make me stay
And the hardest part in all of this is
I know my way back, I don't want to go
And let you see, all that has become of me
I should've known, I should've known
I didn't have a chance

How cold have I become?
I didn't want to
Lose you by what I'd done
Caught in the grey
It burns for a moment but
But then it numbs you
Takes you and leaves you just
Caught in the grey
In your deepest pain
In your weakest hour
In your darkest night
You are lovely
(you tell me)
In your deepest pain
In your weakest hour
In your darkest night
You are lovely 
I am standing on the edge of returning or just running away"
Get Well,Get Well,Icon For Hire,"We throw tantrums like parties
We're not happy 'till everyone knows we're sick
And that's just how we like it
We've hurt bad enough, right, we've earned it

Don't tell the others, but it's all getting old
I mean, how any more times must our stories be told?
And being lonely's only fun in a group
It sort of loses it's charm when it's true

I meant it when I said I wanna get well, I wanna get well
Are the rest of you so content?
Stay where you are but it hurts like help
And I'm sure it was fun at first
Test your pulse and check your vitals
If it's only a game, you lost me
I quit it with the suicidal recital

So now you know all my secrets
I want out, I know I don't need this!
I want friends who don't rank me on what I've been through
The more a battle scars, the more attention it gets you



Yea, we should've known it would end this way
What did you expect, pretend it all away?
And all we've got left is a sorry pile of hearts
I'm getting out, gonna write myself a new start
Come on, dry your eyes, meet me on the other side
Run as fast as you can and we'll make it out alive
We know better now, we don't have to live like this
Go and tell them all we don't have to live like this
I meant it when I said I wanna get well

If it's only a game, you lost me
I quit it with the suicidal recital"
Happy Hurts,Happy Hurts,Icon For Hire,"Happy hurts sometimes, Oh
Blame it on the monsters in my mind
I've been getting better at slowly getting worse, oh
What's wrong with me when happy hurts? Happy hurts

This on again off again temperamental affection
For my darling depression is making me go mad
I hear there's a fine line between crazy and sad
But i can't tell a difference up close
There's a lot of us you know, ill and un-diagnosed
But i don't need a piece of paper to tell me what i already know
I'm not alright for tonight can we let that be alright?
Pick up the battle again in the morning light

And I'm fighting so hard to come out of the dark
Trying to turn off the night finally let in the light
Trying to make my misery just a piece of my history
A little less victim a little more victory

Happy hurts sometimes, Oh
Blame it on the monsters in my mind. Oh
I've been getting better at slowly getting worse, oh
What's wrong with me when happy hurts? Happy hurts

So today i feel okay guess it was all just in my head
I just need to try harder i guess...
Yeah everyone else in the world seems to be doing alright
""Yeah i'm alright"" for tonight  can we let the pain and the happy mix?
Can the two coexist? The beauty next to the mess
Because i swear i have them both already beating in my chest
If that makes me crazy the numbers don't lie
But i don't call that crazy i call that being alive

And I'm fighting so hard to come out of the dark
Trying to turn off the night finally let in the light
Trying to make my misery just a piece of my history
A little less victim a little more victory please

Happy hurts sometimes, Oh
Blame it on the monsters in my mind. Oh
I've been getting better at slowly getting worse, oh
What's wrong with me when happy hurts? Happy hurts
[Bridge[
If i had to pick between the way that i am and the way that everybody else seems to pretend
I wouldn't consider it not for even a second between psycho and sanity it's not even a question
My favorite part of my self seems to make the least sense, 
all the cracks in my skin they just let the light in
My favorite part of my self seems to make the least sense
All the cracks in my skin let the light in

Happy hurts sometimes, Oh
All i want's the one thing i can't find
I've been getting better at slowly getting worse, oh
What's wrong with me when happy hurts?
What's wrong with me when happy hurts?
I've been getting better at slowly getting worse, oh
What's wrong with me when happy hurts?
Happy hurts"
Iodine,Iodine,Icon For Hire,"I say I wanna be healthy, but I turn up the noise
The IV drips a steady stream of poison
I think I'm just in love with the feeling
Break my bones so I can feel them healing

""Crazy"" is, I believe, the medical term
When we wanna recover, but we don't wanna learn
Keep breaking what's been fixed a thousand times
And gimme some more of that iodine

I can't make reality connect
I push till I have nothing left
But if we want to wake up
Why we still singin' these lullabies?
I'll run in circles till I crash
One day these steps will be my last
But if we want to wake up
Why we still singin' these lullabies?

I say I wanna be happy, but I quickly forget
Will I sabotage all the good I've got left?
Depression's like a big fur coat
It's made of dead things but it keeps me warm

""Crazy"" is, I believe, the medical term
When we wanna recover, but we don't wanna learn
Keep breaking what's been fixed a thousand times
And gimme some more of that iodine

I can't make reality connect
I push till I have nothing left
But if we want to wake up
Why we still singin' these lullabies?
I'll run in circles till I crash
One day these steps will be my last
But if we want to wake up
Why we still singin' these lullabies?

I don't like pain, but I bring it to life
I don't like scars but I am good with a knife
I don't like tears when I'm starting to cry
And then I realize I'm destroying my life
I do this to myself
I do this to myself
Stop blaming someone else
We do this to ourselves

I can't make reality connect
I push till I have nothing left
But if we want to wake up
Why we still singin' these lullabies?
I'll run in circles till I crash
One day these steps will be my last
But if we want to wake up
Why we still singin' these lullabies?

So if we want to wake up
Why we still singin' these, why we still singin' these lullabies?"
Sorry About Your Parents,Sorry About Your Parents,Icon For Hire,"I'm sorry about your parents, they sound like bad people
Your daddy sounds like a jerk
I guess your mama didn't know the gift she got when she got you
I'm sorry about your life, you had it pretty rough
Bending over backwards, never good enough
You poor thing, it must suck to be you

And I know it's not your fault, it never is, is it?

I (I) know what it's like staying up all night nursing wounds
It takes (takes) more than I have, pick fights with the past, I always lose
Oh, don't you know? That's no way to live
I (I) know what it's like staying up all night nursing wounds

I get it, give me a little credit
I remember when I was that pathetic
Wear my scars on my sleeve, for all the world to see
Like look what they did to me quick, lay on the sympathy thick
You probably have the right to feel how you do
You were mistreated and cheated out of the childhood you needed
And now you'll never succeed if you're so convinced you're defeated
If you're obsessed with your yesterday then you're destined to repeat it

And I know it's not your fault, it never is, is it, is it, is it?

I (I) know what it's like staying up all night nursing wounds
It takes (takes) more than I have, pick fights with the past, I always lose

Hollow (Bonus Track),Hollow (Bonus Track),Icon For Hire,"I don't wanna break down, but I'm feeling low
Let me sink to the bottom
Air in my lungs keeping me afloat
Inside I'm still hollow

I know I'm not my thoughts
But my thoughts don't know that yet
Sometimes I try to sneak up
On the voice inside my head
I try to meditate, cause they told me it'll help
But the last thing I need is more time alone inside myself
I know I'm not unique, we all got broken brains
Culture recently decided being crazy is okay
And now we all can talk about it on our social feeds
Having a rough day?
Hashtag mental health awareness week
I know that's progress
We don't have to hide no more
But it leaves me wondering why we ain't said this stuff before
Like were we always all crazy and we all just kept quiet?
Are we on the same page with what we're identifying?
And if crazy's the new normal then it's not that crazy, is it?
Cause the word by definition means it sits outside the system
And how can we tell difference between sick and tryna' fit in?
And if everybody's crazy, then who's supposed to fix it?

I don't wanna break down, but I'm feeling low
Let me sink to the bottom
Air in my lungs keeping me afloat
Inside I'm still hollow

I don't wanna break down
So where do I go?
My screams sink to the bottom
Top of my lungs, just an echo
Inside I'm still hollow

No one told me it could get this bad, this fast
Guess we only hear about the struggle after it's passed
Getting easier to open up, share what we lost
Good to know I'm not alone
But if I'm really being honest
I kinda hope there's something wrong with me
I kind hope this isn't how it's supposed to be, 
supposed to be
I pray to god it's not normal
Crying on the floor
I don't wanna do this anymore

I don't wanna break down, but I'm feeling low

Venom (Bonus Track),Venom (Bonus Track),Icon For Hire,"Misery, misery is the venom in my brain
Killin' me, killin' me, but I don't feel the pain
Running from something that I can't really explain
Misery, misery is the venom in our veins

It's been kind of cold, feeling all alone
Haven't been myself in quite a while, you know
They got in my head, like everybody said
Cautionary tale, how quick the sick can spread

Don't meet their eyes, it's hypnotic
Make you forget that it's toxic
Caught up in all the chaotic
Sold you a lie and you bought it
Before you know it, you're nauseous
Hands down your throat 'til you vomit
Collapse from all the exhaustion
And now they got what they wanted

Misery, misery is the venom in my brain
Killin' me, killin' me, but I don't feel the pain
Running from something that I can't really explain
Misery, misery is the venom in our veins

Na na na, na na na oh-oh

Show me where it hurts, I'll show you how it works
They prey on your fear of how it just gets worse
I can't tell if it's real, though, don't know if it's lethal
Did we drink the poison or just a placebo?

Don't meet their eyes, it's hypnotic
Make you forget that it's toxic
Caught up in all the chaotic
Sold you a lie and you bought it
Before you know it, you're nauseous
Hands down your throat 'til you vomit

So watch your step or you're gonna fall apart
Hold yourself together inside the dark

You're only as strong as you think you are

Don’t it take it away
My sad makes me special

Do you want me to write you another sad song
Would you like that?
Do you want me tell you we’ll never belong
Would you like that?
Cuz the truth is we’re no different than the others
Wearing our sob stories like colors
The truth is we like it, we like it here
We’re better off than we let on I fear

Does it make you sick, the way that we live?
We say we’re over it but we-

Can’t undo the scars
All up and down our hearts
Can’t forget how it felt when it all fell apart
And we talk a big game like we wanna get well
In our prison made of pain
Only fooling ourselves

I want to scream my sick soul alive
I want to look you dead in the eyes
Did you think you were the only one? The only one? The only One?
We’re all holding on trying to make sense of
The insanity that we once loved
We’ve cut up our lives trying put down the knife
Trying to pick up the fight

Does it make you sick, the way that we live?
We say we’re over it but we-

Can’t undo the scars
All up and down our hearts
Can’t forget how it felt when it all fell apart
And we talk a big game like we wanna get well
In our prison made of pain
Only fooling ourselves

Oh I need my pain
Don’t it take it away
My sad makes me special
Oh I need my pain
Don’t it take it away
My sad makes me special

Cuz the truth is we’re no different than the others
The truth is we like it, we like it here
We’re better off than we let on I fear

Can’t undo the scars
All up and down our hearts
Can’t forget how it felt when it all fell apart
And we talk a big game like we wanna get well
In our prison made of pain

Only A Memory,Only A Memory,Icon For Hire,"I can't help but close my eyes for life
And dream a different ending
When I wake, I won't be so exhausted
And I'll stop with my pretending
That I'm fine, I'm fine if I can fool myself tonight
And my lie will drown out all of yours

I will not bend until I break
How much can one bruised body take?
Just not enough to silence me
You're only a memory
I'll scream these words till they come true
Then I will think no more of you
Look back on what I'm going through
This isn't my identity

You will bleed for what your hands have done
You can't outrun your ending
And I'll get well long before you let yourself
I may forgive you but you never will

I will not bend until I break
How much can one bruised body take?
Just not enough to silence me
You're only a memory
I'll scream these words till they come true
Then I will think no more of you
Look back on what I'm going through
This isn't my identity

And I told you, I told you, you had no right
How damaged you must be
Watch you panic, it's tragic, you'll carry this for life
You have my sympathy

I will not bend until I break
How much can one bruised body take?
Just not enough to silence me
You’'e only a memory
I'll scream these words till they come true
Then I will think no more of you
Look back on what I'm going through
This isn't my identity

You're only a memory, this isn't my identity
I will not bend, I will not break
This isn't my identity"
War,War,Icon For Hire,"You and I go deep like water
You and I run red like blood
You know my darkest secrets
I know what you're made of
Drip drop, the rain is falling
I hear it all could flood
One rainy night away
From losing all you love

It's a brilliant game you play
When you lock yourself away and
You make me fight for you, you, you

I can't keep you above water
I can't drag your soul to shore
Don't know how to fix a sinking ship
Or win a losing war
It's a heavy load to carry
And I can't hold on much more
On the surface, it looks perfect
Underneath, it's just a perfect storm

I've so much more to tell you
We're running out of time
It's dark and dangerous
Treading oceans in your mind
Up all night I held your hand
While you wondered in the dark
You know I can't make you better
When all you want to be is lost

It's a brilliant game you play
When you lock yourself away and
You make me fight for you, you, you

I can't keep you above water
I can't drag your soul to shore
Don't know how to fix a sinking ship
Or win a losing war
It's a heavy load to carry
And I can't hold on much more
On the surface, it looks perfect
Underneath, it's just a perfect storm

I can't survive for both of us
I can't hold back the waves
This ocean isn't big enough for both of us
I'll let the water carry me away
I’ll let the water carry me away

I can't keep you above water
I can't drag your soul to shore
Don't know how to fix a sinking ship
Or win a losing war
It's a heavy load to carry
And I can't hold on much more
On the surface, it looks perfect
Underneath, it's just a perfect storm
(I'll let the water carry me down)
(I'll let the water carry me down)
On the surface, it looks perfect
Underneath, it's just a perfect storm
(I'll let the water carry me down)

Underneath, it's just a perfect storm"
Cynics & Critics,Cynics & Critics,Icon For Hire,"We're not cynics, we just don't believe a word you say
We're not critics, we just hate it all anyway

If you're happy and you know it clap your hands like this
Cause the rest of us are wondering what on earth we missed
If you're happy and you know it stomp your feet real loud
The rest of us could use some cheering up right now

Oh, please shoot us up
With something shiny and quick
We like our thrills dirt-cheap
And our irony thick
Oh, whatever, nevermind
We're just crying for help
I guess we'll heal the old-fashioned way
And do it ourselves

Sometimes I think we push your buttons just for fun
Sometimes I think our kind of crazy has already been done
We're a copy, of a copy, everything we swore we'd not be
Yea, the truth hurts, but it hasn't stung enough to stop me

Oh, please can't you give us
Something better than this
We've built up a tolerance
To all of your veteran tricks
You're busy smiling on cue
When you don't have a clue
We're a mess, and we know it
We want you to know too

We're not critics, we just hate it all anyway

If you're happy and you know it
Then there might be something wrong with you
What's the point in holding on
When all of us don't want you to?
It'd make us feel better
Knowing you'd be stuck forever
Sick minds stick together
We can stay sick forever

Oh, this is all we know
Oh, tragic and miserable

You Can’t Kill Us,You Can’t Kill Us,Icon For Hire,"I swear to God at night when I close my eyes
I can still see this little lost girl inside
And I don't know how to help her, I don't know what to do
Supposed to have this figured out but I'm so confused
For years I cried myself to sleep every night
Lived one day at a time, trying to just stay alive
And I knew people had it worse, but that didn't make me better
Took all I had inside just to hold myself together
But I knew I couldn't stop, kept hoping one day
Maybe I'd make it to a stage and tell you 'it's all okay.'
And that 'I love you. Even if I haven't met you yet
Hold on, stay strong and never forget.'

We've been lost, been to the bottom
Beaten up, torn and forgotten
Still we fight, we will survive
Can't kill the fire we feel inside
We've been burned, chained and depleted
Left alone, we're not defeated
Still we fight, we will survive
Can't kill the fire we feel inside

You can't, you can't kill us
You can't, you can't kill us

Everyday I felt a little less pain inside
But at that rate I knew I'd hurt until the day I died
I refused to let the darkness, have the last say
So when it came to call my name, I had to run the other way
Maybe that's what it takes, you have to tell the pain no
Have to let the sick parts of your heart finally go
Make room for the light, let it pull you in close
And if you're ever feeling low, I think you know where to go

We've been lost, been to the bottom
Beaten up, torn and forgotten
Still we fight, we will survive
Can't kill the fire we feel inside
We've been burned, chained and depleted
Left alone, we're not defeated
Still we fight, we will survive
Can't kill the fire we feel inside

You can't, you can't kill us
You can't, you can't kill us

One day we're gonna wake up, we're gonna be alright
We'll look back and be happy that we kept ourselves alive
We'll honor where we came from, see what the hurt was for
But we don't let our past hold us hostage anymore
Cause we got more to give, more to live, more to be
More to who we are than our broken history
Like an army we all know it's not all better yet
But we hold on, stay strong, and never forget
You can't, you can't kill us
You can't, you can't kill us

We've been lost, been to the bottom
Beaten up, torn and forgotten
Still we fight, we will survive
Can't kill the fire we feel inside
We've been burned, chained and depleted
Left alone, we're not defeated
Still we fight, we will survive
Can't kill the fire we feel inside

I know how to put on a pretty pathetic show
I hide backstage
Keep the curtains closed

I'm getting pretty good at feeding them the lines they like
But I don't recognize the girl that I face each night
I can compromise till I'm convinced
It's right

What happened to the girl who could overlook the world?
She never gave a second thought to what the other people thought
What happened to the dream of rejecting the routine?
'Cause they never worked for me

I'm gonna burn this theater down
And pray to God for the strength to help me face the crowd
I wanna live like I lost the script and scream every line like
""This is it!""

They say all the world's a stage
Rewriting your identity is all the rage
Well next act please, I'd like a change
I don't really like pretending
This way

We're all holding our breath, waiting for a reaction

The music is in my blood, you don't understand

Sleepless nights at the black and white keys
I'll let my fingers say it for me

Fate sealed, I guess this is how I feel
Sometimes I swear the lyrics write me
The lyrics write me

You never did approve of the fix I found

Bury all the records in the backyard

You can bury my body in the backyard
When you're not looking I'll go dig myself up
And I know all about the drugs they hide inside the music, I know, I know
I know all about the drugs they hide inside the music

And the preacher at church must've told you about them too
Cause you came home dead set on what you had to do
You said the demons and drugs hide in rock n roll thugs
If I wanna grow up nice, I better give the music up

The melody a remedy to keep me right
You never did approve of my sleepless nights

Bury all the records in the backyard

Fight,Fight,Icon For Hire,"I don’t know how I got here but I refuse to stay
I betrayed myself when I let others have their way
But I am holding on, my finger on the pulse
The sound of my heart pounding tells me there’s still hope

But people don’t like when you put up a fight
And slowly, ever so slowly, I am loosing mine

I’ll fight (fight), fight (fight), fight or be taken out alive
(Fight) fight (fight) nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
Standing on the edge, am I better off dead?
How could I forget that I’m better than this?
I’ve come too far to fade tonight
Fight, or be taken out alive

My thoughts are racing faster than my body can react
The danger doesn’t register, the fear feels like an act
Don’t pull the plug, I swear this isn’t how I want to go
The sound of my heart pounding tells me there’s still hope

But people don’t like when you put up a fight. And slowly, ever so slowly, I am loosing mine

I’ll fight (fight), fight (fight), fight or be taken out alive
(Fight) fight (fight) nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
Standing on the edge, am I better off dead?
How could I forget that I’m better than this?

I’ve survived on life support but I’m stronger than I give myself credit for. These conditions only cure when we prepare ourselves for war.

Living our lives, thought we'd fly

But here we are
Bruised and battle scarred
All our beating hearts
Here we are, here we are
Come this far
Fighting for our lives
Holding on tonight
Here we are, here we are
Here we are
Here we are

We’re not where we thought
But we’re still standing tall
What’s it gonna it to break us
What’s it gonna make us wake up

Thought my now we would all be
All grown up, finally  free
Living our lives, thought we'd fly

But here we are
Bruised and battle scarred
All our beating hearts
Here we are, here we are
Come this far
Fighting for our lives
Holding on tonight
Here we are, here we are
Here we are
Here we are

Didn’t think we’d get this far
Didn’t know if we’d survive
Odds against us, here we are
Can you believe we’re still alive?
Didn’t think we’d get this far
Didn’t know if we’d survive
Odds against us, here we are
Can you believe we’re still alive?

Here we are
Bruised and battle scarred
All our beating hearts
Here we are, here we are
Come this far
Fighting for our lives
Holding on tonight
Here we are, here we are
Here we are"

This been a rough start
Been a rough start
All the scummy feelings displaced
They keep us in the dark
Keep us in the dark
But I get this feeling it's about to change

While they've been pushing us low
We're making this grow
We know something they don't
Gonna reap what they sow

They tried to water us down
Just gave us what we need
Shoved us underground
It just sets us free

They tried to bury us
They didn't know we were
Seeds

Seeds
They didn't know we were
They didn't know we were

From the ashes
From the mud
We just keep climbing on up
Started grass roots and now we're everywhere
Spreading like wild flowers
Spreading like wild flowers

While they've been pushing us low
We're making this grow
We know something they don't
Gonna reap what they sow

Shoved us underground

As the ones who break through to find the sun

We'll go up in flames
And down in flames
As the ones who break through to find the sun

Slow Down,Slow Down,Icon For Hire,"Take me all the places that we used to go
The starlit city, our make-shift home
I'm not scared to hold your hand
On the streets of our own land

Slow down, just breathe
All we have is all we need
Slow down, just breathe
All we have is all we need

We don't have a dollar to our name you know
But you've never seen me smile this big before
(I am lost here, I am lost with you)
And I'm not scared to lose it all
When all I've got is beautiful
(I am lost here, I am lost with you)

Slow down, just breathe
All we have is all we need
Slow down, just breathe
All we have is all we need

Tomorrow holds no promises
Except the ones we've made
We'll go far with hearts like ours
'Til then we've got today
Tomorrow holds no promises
Except the ones we've made
We'll go far with hearts like ours
'Til then we've got today

Slow down, just breathe
All we have is all we need
Slow down, just breathe
All we have is all we need
Slow down, just breathe
All we are is all we dreamed

(I am lost here, I am lost with you)
And I'm not scared to lose it all
When all I've got is beautiful"
Fall Apart,Fall Apart,Icon For Hire,"I bet you didn't think that the more you'd try to kill us
The more we'd rise up, the more we'd wise up
I bet you got your hands full trying to dilute us
You've hit a brick wall, won't weaken out resolve
We've already given away
What you're trying to take, what you're trying to take
When you've died a thousand deaths, what's one more
We look you in the eyes and we say, and we say
Seize our families take our homes away
We don't fall apart, we don't fall apart
I guess you didn't think that so many were willing
To disown their lives, to say their goodbyes
I don't think you have any idea just what you're killing
We will walk on, we live on
He is no fool to give what he can't save
To gain the one thing that nobody can take
Though it may cost us everything
We look you in the eyes and we say
Seize our families take our homes away
We don't fall apart, we don't fall apart
Body after body to the grave
We don't fall apart, we don't fall apart
Death without love profits nothing
I must be still alive
(I must be still alive)
Seize our families take our homes away
We don't fall apart, we don't fall apart
Body after body to the grave
We don't fall apart, we don't fall apart"
Call Me Alive,Call Me Alive,Icon For Hire,"Come call me alive
Your heart carries mine
Don't leave me to die
Alright
VI:
I shouldn't have let them have me
Now it's to late for regrets
Will I ever learn
Or am I doomed to burn
I keep tasting it
I keep choking
Take my water, take my oxygen
They never could help me, I'm left just as empty tonight
VII:
I can't give in to madness
And let them numb me over
Wait to weaken me
Take me piece by piece
I'm poised for the kill
Don't dare swallow
Chorus:
Take my water, take my oxygen, They never could help me I'm left just as empty tonight
I will stop at nothing less than you
Ruined me, you've ruined me
Nothing else moves me
Bridge:
Promise me you'll hunt me down
Or it's torn for now
I have come unwound without falling
Promise me you won't back down
Come call me alive
Come call me alive"
Overture,Overture,Icon For Hire,
Carried Away,Carried Away,Icon For Hire,"(I won't be carried away, I say, I say...)
Yeah!
This is as weak as they come, this is as far as I'll run
I'm growing ill with the cure, you're just as hungry for more
I've exhausted all my caution
Breaking down is not an option
Haven't you had enough? Aren't you tired?
Well, this is where I draw the line
Haven't you had your fill of the empty?
Aren't you ready to sing, ""I won't be carried away""
Good grief and give it a rest, my struggle never relents
We'll never know what it costs, until we're too weak to stop
I've exhausted all my caution
Breaking down is not an option
Haven't you had enough? Aren't you tired?
Well, this is where I draw the line
Haven't you had your fill of the empty?
Aren't you ready to sing, ""I won't be carried away""
(I won't be carried away  I say, I say)
I won't be carried away! 
Haven't you had enough? Aren't you tired?
Well, this is where I draw the line
Haven't you had your fill of the empty?
Aren't you ready to sing, ""I won't be carried away"" (Carried away!)"
Theater,Theater,Icon For Hire,"My life is a musical, I know how to put on
A pretty pathetic show, I hide
Backstage, keep the curtains closed
'Cause I'm scared, I'm scared
I'm getting pretty good at feeding them
The lines they like but I don't
Recognize the girl I face each night
I can compromise till I'm convinced, it's right
What happened to the girl who could overlook the world?
She never gave a second to what the other people thought
What happened to the dream of rejecting the routine?
'Cause they never worked for me
I'm gonna burn this theater down
And pray to God for the strength to help me face the crowd
I wanna live like I lost the script
And scream every line like this is it
They say all the world's a stage
Rewriting your identity is all the rage
Well, next act please, I'd like a change
I don't really like pretending this way
What happened to the girl who could overlook the world?
She never gave a second to what the other people thought
What happened to the dream of rejecting the routine?
'Cause they never worked for me
I'm gonna burn this theater down
And pray to God for the strength to help me face the crowd
I wanna live like I lost the script
And scream every line like this is it
I'm gonna burn this theater down
And pray to God for the strength to help me face the crowd
I wanna live like I lost the script
And scream every line like this is it
And the sad thing is we're all in on the action
We're all holding our breath, waiting for a reaction
You play your part, I'll be playing with matches
And if you'd like a show, you can follow the ashes
I'm gonna burn this theater down
And pray to God for the strength to help me face the crowd
I wanna live like I lost the script
And scream every line like this is it
I'm gonna burn this theater down
And pray to God for the strength to help me face the crowd
I wanna live like I lost the script
And scream every line like this is it"
Pernilla,Pernilla,Icon For Hire,"VI
I can't help but close my eyes for life
And dream a different ending
When I wake I won't be so exhausted
And I'll stop with my pretending
That I'm fine; I'm fine if I can fool myself tonight
And my lie will drown out all of yours
VII
You will bleed for what your hands have done
You can't outrun your ending
And I'll get well long before you let yourself
I may forgive you but you never will
Chorus:
I will not bend until I break
How much can one bruised body take
Just not enough to silence me
You're only a memory
I'll scream these words 'till they come true
Then I will think no more of you
Look back on what I'm going through
This isn't my identity
Bridge:
And I told you, I told you
You had no right, how damaged you must be
Watch you panic, it's tragic, you'll carry this for life
You have my sympathy
This isn't my identity, you're only a memory...."
Last One Standing,Last One Standing,Icon For Hire,"They always come for the wild wants
They always come for the freaks
I don't think quite like be like you
And all they come for me
They always one of change me
They wanna make me weak
I don't keep quite like be like you
And all they come for me

An easy target, an easy mark
I high you think got caught this far

I'll take this moment like I own it
Ain't seen the last of me
Cause I'm awake the last one standing
One through the fire
It takes me higher
Ain't seen the last of me
Cause I'm awake the last one standing

I won't let you kill me and I like you could
They say you only die one time and I'm make mine good
You think you got me corner

You dead and got the best of me I save that  myself

An easy target, an easy mark
I high you think got caught this far
I turn the face you

Before I dead

They always come for the freaks
They always come for the misfit
Like you like you and me

They always come for the freaks
They always come for the misfit
Like you like you and me

I'll take this moment like I own it
Ain't seen the last of me
