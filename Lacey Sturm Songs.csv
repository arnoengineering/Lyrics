Mercy Tree,Mercy Tree,Lacey Sturm,"On a hill called Calvary
Stands an endless mercy tree
Every broken weary soul
Find your rest and be made whole
Stripes of blood that stain its frame
Shed to wash away our shame
From the scars pure love released
Salvation by the mercy tree
In the spot between two thieves
Hung the blameless Prince of Peace
Bruised and battered, scarred and scorned
Sacred head pierced by our thorns
It is finished was His cry
The perfect lamb was crucified
His sacrifice, our victory
Our Savior chose the mercy tree
Hope went dark that violent day
The whole earth quaked at love's display
Three days silent in the ground
This body born for heaven's crown
On that bright and glorious day
When heaven opened up the grave
He's alive and risen indeed!
Praise Him for the mercy tree!
Death has died, love has won
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
Jesus Christ has overcome
He has risen from the dead
Death has died, love has won
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
Jesus Christ has overcome
He has risen from the dead
One day soon, we'll see His face
And every tear, He'll wipe away
No more pain or suffering
Praise Him for the mercy tree
Death has died, love has won
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
Jesus Christ has overcome
He has risen from the dead
Death has died, love has won
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
Jesus Christ has overcome
He has risen from the dead
On a hill called Calvary
Stands an endless mercy tree"
The Reason,The Reason,Lacey Sturm,"All my life, I've searched for something
To satisfy the longing in my heart
And every time I come away
Emptier than before

And now I finally see the reason
'Cause I was made to be yours alone

You formed my heart with your own hands
But I just could not understand
If I gave you my life
I'd be healed by your Grace
I was made for Your love
And gave others Your place

I spent my days giving my heart away to anything new
Only to ache from the poison of my temporary muse
And there were times I'd cry myself to sleep at night
Only to wake up wishing that I didn't

And now I finally see the reason
'Cause I was made to be yours alone

You formed my heart with your own hands
But I just could not understand
If I gave you my life
I'd be healed by your Grace
I was made for Your love
And gave others Your place

Thank you for never giving up on me
When I looked to everything else and lived so selfishly
You bled, you died to be with me
Why would you do something like that for someone like me?

And now I finally see the reason
'Cause I was made to be yours alone

You formed my heart with your own hands
And now I finally understand
And I give you my life
And I'm healed by your Grace
I was made for your love that no one can replace
This is it
I won't miss everything I am made for
To be yours
All yours"
Rot,Rot,Lacey Sturm,"I can't hold my head up in this dark room anymore
I need a lightning bolt to raise me from this grave
Here comes fresh fire
Fresh fire, fresh fire
So infatuated by the darkness and so surrounded by the light
Oh my God, save my soul
And still I want what's pure and want what's right
But I need another fix tonight
Oh my God, save my soul
Beneath her glowing eyes that call like fire to a moth
The most disgusting lies are dressed in beauty that'll rot
Oh my God, you've won the coldest battle we've fought
Deliverance is mine, from all this beauty that'll rot
Mirror mirror on the wall, will there be glory if I fall?
Oh my God, save my soul
I need a faith that's solid as concrete, but the impact's broken both my knees
Oh my God, save my soul
Beneath her glowing eyes that call like fire to a moth
The most disgusting lies are dressed in beauty that'll rot
Oh my God, you've won the coldest battle we've fought
Deliverance is mine, from all this beauty that'll rot
Don't wanna rot
I can't hold my head up in this dark room anymore
I need a lightning bolt to raise me from this grave
Here comes fresh fire
Breathtaking blinding truth, freedom I never knew
Oh my God, you've won the coldest battle we've fought
Deliverance is mine, from all this beauty that'll rot"
You’re Not Alone,You’re Not Alone,Lacey Sturm,"It’s been hard for me to breathe for such a long time
I only stayed so I could hold you, maybe ease your mind
I can't hold you anymore tonight
And I feel your heart is breaking as I let go
And it hurts me to be leaving but you must know
I can't hold you anymore tonight
When no one else can save you
Remember
You're not alone
Beyond the universe
Echoes out a promise to us
Where the darkness meets the day
You're not alone
Close as the two of us
Stronger than the pain runs through us
You can hear the angels say
You're not alone
You're not alone
When the memories come to haunt you with the sad lie
""No one loves you, they all leave you! So why even try?""
Let truth hold you in loving arms tonight
When you feel like you're the only one you can trust
And it proves a lie when you're the one who self-destructs
Let truth hold you in loving arms tonight
When no one else can save you
Remember
You're not alone
Beyond the universe
Echoes out a promise to us
Where the darkness meets the day
You're not alone
Close as the two of us
Stronger than the pain runs through us
You can hear the angels say
You're not alone
His love will never leave
Truth will not forsake
Eternal thoughts will keep your heart safe
The love will never leave
Truth will not forsake
Eternal thoughts will keep your heart safe
You're not alone
You're not alone
Beyond the universe
Echoes out a promise to us
Where the darkness meets the day
You're not alone
Close as the two of us
Stronger than the pain runs through us
You can feel it when you pray
You're not alone
You're not alone
You're not alone"
Impossible,Impossible,Lacey Sturm,"I can't fly
But I, I keep finding myself soaring high above this
I have nothing left
But I keep on pouring
Out like I am endless
Impossible, (whaa) Impossible

I don't run too fast but I'm looking back
And miles and miles have passed
I can barely breathe but I'm
Singing out like this is nothing to me
Impossible, (whoa) Impossible

Every morning I see another miracle
I can't believe, I'm living the impossible
We are the sign and we are the wonder
Another day of living the impossible
Impossible, Impossible

I choose to be alive
Especially because the odds say I should die
I wrestle death again I know more of
His moves now and I won't give in
Impossible, Impossible
 (X2)
Every morning I see another miracle
I can't believe, I'm living the impossible
We are the sign and we are the wonder
Another day of living the impossible
Impossible, Impossible

When I'm weak I wonder if I'm gonna be alright
But too many times I've seen this all come to life
If I make myself stop and remember
(x2)
Every morning I see another miracle
I can't believe, I'm living the impossible
We are the sign and we are the wonder
Another day of living the impossible
Impossible, Impossible

I'm living the impossible
We are the sign and we are the wonder
I'm living the impossible"
Life Screams,Life Screams,Lacey Sturm,"Grand speeches pour out with the rain
On streets where no one's listening
And you curse the cold wind on your face
But she's trying to tell you something
A song unfolds in the distance
Somehow you feel it in your soul
But you carry on with your business
Like you didn't hear this melody
That calls you home

Life sings out, it's calling you by name
Life screams out that all of this will change
Your lungs are only flesh
And everything that dies will fade away
Life calls for her lover
You will live forever

The sky is asking you to dance
With every drop a whisper
And you wipe her kiss off of your hands
And throw away forever

Life sings out, it's calling you by name
Life screams out that all of this will change
Your lungs are only flesh
And everything that dies will fade away
Life calls for her lover
You will live forever

A song unfolds in the distance
Somehow you feel it in your soul
But you carry on with your business
Like you didn't hear this melody
That calls you home

Life screams out, it's calling you by name
Life screams out that all of this will change
Your lungs are only flesh
And everything that dies will fade away
Life calls for her lover
You will live forever
Live forever"
Feels Like Forever,Feels Like Forever,Lacey Sturm,"My hands are burning again tonight
My heart's awake but I don't feel right
Oh I can feel the heat rise
If I could stand up and face this light
Tearing apart my old disguise
But I can't open my eyes
Still I see you
My mouth is cold, my body whole
I may explode but you feel like forever
Undying temple, your temple
I may explode but you feel like forever
I'm falling over and into you
I am consumed and you feel like forever
I can't stop shaking as you come close
I want to run but I want you most
Is this what it means to die
I hold my breath as I wait on you
Longing to follow your every move
I've never been so alive
Still I see you, oh
My mouth is cold, my body whole
I may explode but you feel like forever
Undying temple, your temple
I may explode but you feel like forever
I'm falling over and into you, oh!
I am consumed and I know you're forever
Yeah I know you're forever
Yeah I know you're forever, oh
And it feels like forever, oh, oh
My mouth is cold, my body whole
I may explode but you feel like forever
Undying temple, your temple
I may explode but you feel like forever
I'm falling over and into you, oh!
I am consumed and you feel like forever
But you feel like forever
But you feel like forever
I'm falling over and into, oh!
I am consumed and you feel like forever"
Run To You,Run To You,Lacey Sturm,"You tell me I'm the one holding you back
And something about how far we're off track
Well all I hear is your heart beat loud and strong
And I just want to wrap you in my arms
But I'll let you go, if that's what you want
But I hope you know my love won't stop
You say it's not true and you call me a fool
But call out my name, I'll run to you
I know you, I know your eyes so well
And I know you're not sure of yourself
Something made you restless years ago
'Til you forgot that I am part of your soul
But I'll let you go, if that's what you want
But I hope you know my love won't stop
You say it's not true and you call me a fool
But call out my name, I'll run to you
I've always believed in you
You used to believe in me too
Remember the day that you turned away
It killed me to lose you
It killed me to lose you
But I'll let you go, if that's what you want
But I hope you know my love won't stop
You say it's not true and you call me a fool
But call out my name, I'll run to you
I'll run to you, I'll run to you
I've always believed in you
Run to you, I'll run to you
And 'cause I love you I'll let you go
If that's what you want
But I hope you know
My love won't stop"
The Soldier,The Soldier,Lacey Sturm,"You draw your line in the sand
So I'm crossing over again
You brag that you’re a grenade
So I pull your pin and I wait

A time will come
When your power is gone
Yeah, I might die in a day
But I'm gonna die anyway
I'm gonna stand my ground
Even if they back down
'Cause I don’t care what you say anymore
So what, you raise your voice
I’m screaming back my choice
'Cause I sure ain't scared of you anymore

What’s a life without a cause
What’s the point of drawing straws
They say that I am a fool
But I’ll do what I have to do

A time will come
When this war is won
Yeah, I might die in a day
But I’m gonna die anyway
I'm gonna stand my ground
Even if they back down
'Cause I don’t care what you say anymore
So what, you raise your voice
I’m screaming back my choice
'Cause I sure ain’t scared of you anymore

I've seen a dying man
Pleading for one more chance
Only to fade to black
And that’s why I’m going back

I'm back
!!
I'm gonna stand my ground
Even if they back down
'Cause I don’t care what you say anymore
So what, you raise your voice
I’m screaming back my choice (Choice!!)
'Cause I sure ain’t scared of you anymore
No, I'm not scared of you anymore"
Vanity,Vanity,Lacey Sturm,"- I don't think I want to do this anymore
- Look, you want me to ask for forgiveness again and again, like you're telling me
My love isn't complete
I say it's more like a runaway. I guess, I guess I don't have the right to ask for
Forgiveness then, right?
- I want to believe what I heard somewhere a long time ago that, that love is free
And kind
And you're trying to act like you're all humble and wise
But what you call love is destroying my life and it's destroying your soul (Destroying
Your life?) if you ever had one
I don't even think you even know what it means to love. Or to be loved
- See, see look, look we've got so much to learn
It's like this thrifty and new words they seem perfect and then they corner us like
This, like this Leonidas curse with a Midas touch
And it's mighty rum. Listen this is the real, that gritty, gory, and gorgeous, it's
Like, it's like coco butter laced with sandpaper
See this is love
- Of course your words, so enticing and the imagery like some Messiah living and
Dying for me and then asking to save me
But what, what about the freedom that love brings? What about the protection that
Love brings?
- See, oh, oh, yeah, so, so this is your kiss to send me off right? Like I ain't
Been no shelter!
- Shelter?
- Like those bruises on your arms ain't no badges of honor?
And these ornery onlookers they keep questioning my methods
But look, this means I am in your atrium, like ancient drones
You used to dance with me. Why can't you just dance with me?
- You mean slavery?!
- Slavery? You owe me your life!
- I don't belong to anyone but me!
- Oh wait which, which one of us is being selfish here?
- Who could be selfish?
- Yeah, you trying to rob me?
- I can't owe what you never gave!
- You will always owe me
- And the love you gave was never love!"
Faith,Faith,Lacey Sturm,"Laughter tickles my tongue
A breathless chase has begun
I'm gonna let you win
Catch me, I'm falling in
Love, oh what have I done?
Love how you gamble your pride
Amazed how strong you are
You risk looking in my eyes
And let me melt your heart
Will you always
Chase me like this?
Will time and space
Leave when we kiss?
Curses burning my tongue
I wonder if you're enough
I promised forever
Am I a liar?
Love, oh what have I done?
Love how you gamble your pride
Amazed how strong you are
You risk looking in my eyes
And let me break your heart
Will you always
Chase me like this?
Will time and space
Leave when we kiss?
I was divided
My heart was so confused
My heart's a lion and I used to know the truth
I have decided
I'm gonna follow through
I wanna gamble and fall in love with you
I hear your heartbeat
You're singing to me
Will you always
Chase me like this?
Will time and space
Leave when we kiss?"
I’m Not Laughing,I’m Not Laughing,Lacey Sturm,"She's walking on eggshells
Biting off her tongue
She's still searching for herself
But it ain't pleasing no one
And none of you know her anyway
You don't even want to
They aren't your tears, it ain't your pain
So what's it too you?
I'm not laughing
Don't get confused!
I'm not pointing my finger
Don't want to be like you
No! No! No!
She doesn't know she's beautiful
Cause all she ever hears
Is your insecure loud mouth
Feeding off her fears
And all you know is that everyone is looking at her now
You shoot her with your mouth, your gun
But I can hit too somehow
I'm not laughing
Don't get confused!
I'm not pointing my finger
Don't want to be like you
No! No!
I'm not laughing
Don't get confused!
I'm not pointing my finger
Don't want to be like you
No!
(Stop it! Now!)
(Stop it! Now!)
I'm not laughing
Don't get confused
I'm not pointing my fingers
I'll never be like you
No! No!
I'm not laughing
Don't get confused!
I'm not pointing my finger
Don't want to be like you
No! No! No!
(I'm not laughing)
(I'm not like you! I'm not like you!)
(I'm not like you! I'm not like you!)
(I'm not laughing)
(I'm not like you! I'm not like you!)
(I'll never be like you!)"
The Decree,The Decree,Lacey Sturm,"Help

She collects grey drops of rain inside
The bottom of her glass
Till the world has gone from upside down
To right side up again
'Cause she believes till she can see
Five long months looking at trees
That seem like they are dead
Blackened, twisted, broken, still
Full bloom inside her head
'Cause she believes till she can see

Turning the pages
Unlock these cages

Quiet days we can hear this sound
Heaven's throne in the earth come down
The decree's out now
Never been so loud
Making way for the undoing
Of the death in everything
The decree's out now
Never been so loud

The time's not near, it's here
A holy fear is here

When the world is laughing at itself
All she can do is cry
But when the world is scared and crying out
She laughs, fearless inside
'Cause she believes till she can see
Floating freely, breathing easy
Over stratospheres
Eternity throws glory stars
Redeeming all the years
Do you believe and will you dream?

Turning the pages
Open these cages

Quiet days we can hear this sound
Heaven's throne in the earth come down
The decree's out now
Never been so loud
Making way for the undoing
Of the death in everything
The decree's out now
Never been so loud

The time's not near, it's here
A holy fear is here
Is here

(Majesty)

Quiet days we can hear this sound
Heaven's throne in the earth come down
The decree's out now
Never been so loud
Making way for the undoing
Of the death in everything
The decree's out now
Never been so loud

The time's not near, it's here
A holy fear is here
The time's not near, it's here
A holy fear is here"

Heavy Prey,Heavy Prey,Lacey Sturm,"Who sent me here?

Betrayed by your kiss, hurry, finish
You wasted your chance, I'm provoked
So I bleed till it is finished
And I prove that my gifts have revoked

And I won't repent from this
I won't repent from this, blood is binding
Love, you were meant for this flesh
You were meant for this life by dying
I won't repent from this
I won't repent from this, blood is binding
Love, you were meant for this flesh
You were meant for this love

You're my flesh and blood
You're my flesh and blood
You're my flesh and blood

You'll never feel at home
Anywhere, anywhere you go
And when you sit around
All your questions, they start to grow
They won't give you any answers
And they lie about what they don't know

But I won't repent from this
I won't repent from this, blood is binding
Love, you were meant for this flesh
You were meant for this life by dying

But it burns when I hear my inflection in your voice
Don't you see all my soul that is yours?
When you stand in the truth, upholding you

State of Me,State of Me,Lacey Sturm,
Mystery,Mystery,Lacey Sturm,"I've been trying to get away from myself
And when I try to speak out, there's no help
You caught me with steady eyes
Speaking low like a sunrise
You noticed me like no one else
You noticed me like no one else

And it's a mystery right in front of me
How a father loves a daughter
What does all that mean?
And how did you know me so well
Like you seem to?
And do you really love me
Like your eyes say you do?

I made a plan to run away from this war
'Cause I don't wanna hurt you anymore
But you fought through my firewalls
Above the war I heard you call
You rescued me like I'm yours
You rescued me like I'm yours

And it's a mystery right in front of me
How a father loves a daughter
What does all that mean?
And how did you know me so well
Like you seem to?
And do you really love me
Like your eyes say you do?

'Cause I learn what love means by how You love me
But when You love me it's still hard to believe
'Cause I don't understand what Your purity means
So I just wanna thank you for waiting on me
'Cause I learn what love means by how You love me
But when You love me it's still hard to receive
'Cause I don't understand what all of this means
But I just wanna thank you for having patience with me

'Cause it's a mystery right in front of me
How a father loves a daughter
What does all that mean?
And how did you know me so well
Like you seem to?
And do you really love me
Like your eyes say you do?
You do"
Sacred,Sacred,Lacey Sturm,"Verse:
I know it seems like there is nothing sacred anymore and the world is dark lit up with only flames of war. It’s such an empty place when longing for human praise they walk away; I’m left wide open and my heart breaks wide open.
Chorus:
I hear there’s a sacred place, just within heaven’s gates
If only heaven’s gates were open
If only heaven’s gates were open
But all I have is a broken heart and all I do is fall apart
If only heaven’s gates were open
If only heaven’s gates were open"
Time,Time,Lacey Sturm,"Time is a measure
Abstract, it’s a number
Created to measure the will
Time I rolls as humans make choices
Time holds death but it doesn’t kill
The will of every human measured
Time is the great divine ledger
Our choices becoming a journal
But choices are made in freedom
Freedom, now that is eternal
Time is just a location
Time appears like a fading star
Just a galaxy in the universe of freedom
Unfolding to show who we are
Choices are always alive as
Eternal moments of freedom
The free choice of man will rest of strive
To destroy or restore Eden
But time just measures the will
And when it’s done giving it’s gift
Time will be rolled up and put away
The mere measuring tape that it is
Freedom is a choice
Terrifying responsibility of right
Our choices of death are only erased
By the blood of Jesus Christ
He set before us life and death
And pleads for us to choose life
He honors our freedom whatever we choose
But gives us the chance to love right
He chooses the ones who will choose him
And he is both the first and the last
Our choices are eternal
But Christ’s blood re-writes the past
We all have the opportunity
To turn our will toward him
Love him back for his mercy
Believe by his blood he forgives
So choose life or choose death
Come to light or hide in the dark
And with every choice you make
Time will measure who you are
God is always speaking
Father of ya all
Holy Ghost of Jesus Christ
Calling you, he calls:
“You are the parallel universe
You are the split
In your heart choose life or death
And I will honor it
I am the one
With my blood, who boots out paths of death
But you must choose if you will me to
Or will you keep running ahead?
Yes, parallel universes are possibilities
And they exist within you
And you move back and forth with ease
And enter the futures you choose
Each one is a parallel universe
Eternal souls covered in mud
Freedom is unending parallel universes
And they all intersect with my blood
When each one comes to this crossroad
All wills make a choice
From these points on forever
Life or death will have a voice.”"
Breath of Eternity,Breath of Eternity,Lacey Sturm,"Verse:
Seems like I’m always waiting to come back here. When life starts to lead my minds else where, the ache begins low and grows to hunger that I can’t control. My soul starts to wonder, where did you go? When did I leave? I didn’t mean to, but I always miss you.
Pre-Chorus
Breath of eternity forever alive in me, hold my thoughts in your strong arms. I bring you my whole life, all I am inside.
Chorus-
There’s no one more beautiful, there’s no live truer than you. I want my whole life to be ceaseless worship to you."
Christmas Song,Christmas Song,Lacey Sturm,"Verse 1:
A frightened virgin teenage girl receives a message that defies the laws of this world
All she can do is weep and nod; she’s to bring into this world the Son of God.
Chorus:
God’s angels sound their trumpets and blow their horns
Tonight the long awaited Savior’s to be born
The goodness bound by satan has been torn
With this baby’s precious brow ready for thorns.
Verse2:
A star appears fulfilling an ancient prophecy
There’s an ounce of fear as wise men follow faithfully
The virgin Mary brings forth a human savior
And this future king sleeps soundly in a manger
Tonight He is born so one day He can die
To heal hearts that are torn and live a perfect life
So He can hang upon a cross and we can take His life
So we can live as sinners and He can pay the price
Tonight He is born so day He can die...
But He will rise again!"
